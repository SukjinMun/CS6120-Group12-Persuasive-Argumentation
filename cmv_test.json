    "chosen": "&gt;1) Any attempt for the wealthy to reduce their taxes will result in destroying their own voting power. This is key and many people don't get this. The system is self correcting in that you cannot choose to not pay tax and also control the government at the same time.\n\nActually, all they'd have to do is make sure that nobody else paid more than them.  As long as they make more money, they can consistently reduce their own tax rate.\n\n&gt;2) You would get a vote size proportional to your contribution to society. It seems rather fair that you should have a bigger say of what to do with the money if you contribute more.\n\nParis Hilton will inherit gobs of money and has contributed nothing of value to society.  She is verifiably stupid.  I question not whether she should have more power than me and a thousand of my friends, but whether she should vote at all.\n\nHaving money and paying taxes does not equate to contributing to society; it rests on the false assumptions that all wealth is garnered from positive participation in the economy and that all money paid to the government provides mutual benefit to the people.\n\n&gt;3) There is a high correlation between intelligence and income. Weighing votes this way would help to put more voting power into the hands of people who are more likely to make better decisions.\n\nThere is a much higher correlation between the pursuit of self interest and income. The rich have been lobbying for advantageous government policy since states were a thing, so while they may be disproportionately intelligent, that doesn't make them ethical or magnanimous by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n&gt;4) We'll finally be able to have smart politicians instead of popular politicians in office. From what I've seen, the smartest politicians who can actually address issues are not popular.\n\nI think it's much more likely that we'll have politicians who collude with those who put them in office and ignore those who are essentially irrelevant to the political process.  When you purposefully disenfranchise *most* people, you don't have a functioning democracy.  You have an oligarchy.  You're relying on the magnanimity of the wealthy to ensure the rights and well-being of people who have no say in the matter.",

The system is self correcting in that you cannot choose to not pay tax and also control the government at the same time.\n\nThis reasoning makes sense given the current political climate but it doesn't cover loopholes where people who pay a large proportion of taxes vote for government programs which return money and benefits to them indirectly (not reducing their tax burden). You aren't accounting for how self-interest will manifest with this new voting system.\n\n&gt; 2) You would get a vote size proportional to your contribution to society. It seems rather fair that you should have a bigger say of what to do with the money if you contribute more.\n\nA person's income and assets can't be the only metrics for societal contributions, can it? If a banker works for a foreign company and lives in the United States, is his societal contribution more than a truck driver who makes less money but whose job is transporting products domestically? I would argue that the banker makes fewer contributions because his job does not benefit the domestic economy unlike the truck driver. Why would the banker be more qualified to make decisions about a society he is not fully invested in?\n"

    "chosen": "I'll argue with the \"due to\". We'll just take for granted that there's a lot more \"monthly bills\" today than there were in decades past. Cable and smartphones didn't exist in the 1960's (though I think you're discounting how many subscription services used to be necessary that technology has eliminated. No one gets delivered blocks of ice to their ice box anymore, for example)\n\nBut let's look at [how the family budget has actually evolved in the last century](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/print/2012/04/how-america-spends-money-100-years-in-the-life-of-the-family-budget/255475/). Note in particular that the price of food has gone down dramatically, from about 30% of the family budget in 1950 to 15% today. This is largely due to increased efficiencies is modern farming and distribution. That's 15% savings that go right into the pockets of families, or an extra $4500 or so less taxes. That's easily enough to pay for a cable and smartphone bill.\n\nSo it's simply not the extra necessities that are breaking family's budgets, because the costs of all necessities have decreased dramatically, even when you include the new ones.\n\nSo why is it so hard to support a family today on a single income compared to previous decades, especially given that it was more expensive to do so then?\n\nThe answer is income stagnation. [Workers haven't gotten a raise since 1980 or so](http://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/photos/wages_overtime_UnitedStates.png), and many have actually lost ground. It's harder to raise a family today not because we're spending more than our parents and grandparents, but because we're poorer compared to them.",

If anything its cheaper now than it was. \n\nYes you need a cell phone, but you no longer need a home phone, so that is pretty even. \n\nA computer and internet connection are nice, but not necessary. Many people use the library, and with a decent cell phone package you can easily cross internet off your list. \n\nYou talk about the burden of providing them for family members, but an internet connection for a single person or a family is still goign to be the same cost. Generally speaking, many kids don't have cell phones until they are in middle school at the earliest. And even with that, on my unlimited data smart phone plan its only something like $25/month to add an extra line. \n\nHealth insurance would be free for people in this income range as well. \n\nEssentially, what you are lamenting is the lack of minimum wage increases, as 2 parents working minimum wage full time make around 30k. If minimum wage had kept up with inflation, then this wouldn't be the issue. \n\nthe idea that you shouldn't have kids if you can't afford to give them a cell phone is a bit extreme though.

    "prompt": "Cultural appropriation by means of a personal tattoo is not immoral.",
    "chosen": "Usually cultural appropriation is harmful when people choose to utilize, or \"appropriate\", positive elements while ignoring or leaving behind more unpleasant elements. For example, white suburban kids listening to Gansta Rap and wearing do-rags while not having ever (or will ever) experience the specific circumstances that led to those becoming relevant icons in the Black community. Or, more recently, white people wearing headdresses to music festivals (or getting them tattooed on them). Headdresses are, in many Native American cultures, a very sacred and symbolic motif used for specific practices and people. White people who wear them are choosing to ignore the negative parts of Native life and cherry-pick aesthetics. I can go more in depth but that's not the point.\n\nYou are interested in \"appropriating\" from a culture that hasn't had a lot of presence since the 16th century. Though I'm sure you could find an Incan descendent somewhere with an issue there, I doubt you will run into many of them. However, I wanted to address two points:\n\n1. Aesthetics\n\nThis is the primary argument used by people who want to utilize symbols or costumes from other cultures. You understand this is not generally considered a way of \"honoring\" the culture, but picking pieces you think are \"pretty\" with very little regard for their weight or history? Usually, when discussing cultural appropriation in an academic string, this has no weight.\n\n2. \"I may possibly incorporate their symbols for the sun, their main focus of focus worship. Although nonreligious myself, I respect that worshiping the material sun and nature around us is an important trait more of us should take note of.\"\n\nLet's say it wasn't the Incan culture, and it was Hindu. You admit to not being religious, but like certain aspects of their religion, which they probably take very seriously and personally. Do you see how this could be seen as trivializing, white-washing, and \"appropriating\" something that you admittedly don't follow in your own life? It's like saying \"Native Americans worship nature\". \n\n3. I hold a lot of respect for what their civilization accomplished, and would like to \"advertise\" them more through body art\n\nDo you think people don't know about the Incan civilization? Or are you attempting to create solidarity between you and those of Incan descent? Sorry, I don't really understand this point. ",
    "rejected": "If you are taking the specific images from a different culture that you have no direct ties to, (Academic curiosity is not a direct tie.) you are claiming those ties. \n\nIf, however, you are inspired by those designs and incorporate some of the aesthetics and styles into your sleeve that is different. Then you are only saying \"Hey, I like this aesthetic style\". \n\nMohawks are a perfect study of this. Yes, there is a Mohawk tribe of Iroquois. But the strip of hair down the center of the head with clean shaven sides is not specific to that culture, or even common within it. It just became synonymous with that tribes name because white people choose to ignore inconvenient things like \"facts\" when creating style and entertainment. \n\nSo now we're stuck with the name along with lumping all of the native tribes in the Americas together as \"Indians\", the Irish drunk stereotype along with countless other examples or inappropriate appropriation and misleading but interesting factoids. \n\nSo for things already in the general public's consciousness.. yeah. There is a whole lot of appropriation that is going on that we actually know is wrong.. but people are loathe to change their terminology etc. and it's generally fairly neutral compared to other issues facing an appropriated community. Neutral in terms of direct impact. Still not necessarily right... but tolerable. Sometimes... it's a really really grey area that anybody can justify whatever they want inside of to be honest. \n\nSo into that broiling frothing mix you want an Incan Tattoo. Not ignorantly, like a kid who hasn't been taught about WW2 saying they want a tattoo like their Jewish great grandmothers. But willfully and knowingly. \n\nIf you are Incan, have Incan Anscestry or had the tattoo offered by an Incan tribe as a sign of repect and thanks... that would be fine. \n\nBut you really just like the look. \n\nSo make the aesthetics your own without co-opting the meaning behind them. Think about the things that are important to you and use your own designs and interpretations to express your life. Where you have been, where you are, and where you are going. Then if you still want to use that aesthetic as a template you at least aren't stealing other peoples experiences and claiming them as your own. Some would still claim that doing that is too much cultural appropriation. But yet they won't burn their Beatles records... Hypocrites... "

Even if the artificial superheavy elements are not useful in our every day life, if we left them out, there would be holes in the table, never to be filled.\n\nI don't think we should look at the elements in the table one by one. The atomic mass of oxygen alone is not very interesting. The important information is \"how different\" it is from the nearby elements.

Well, if you would ask the average westerner, probably over 90% would agree with that statement. Equalism won. Huzzah! \n\nWhat you are missing here, is that feminism is not just a *brand name* that is trying to be as popular as possible, but an actual set of actual sociological theories about *how and why* people are as inequal as they are. \n\nWhen people don't see universally sexualized characters in video games as a problem because \"male characters are objectified too\", or don't see what's wrong with women in general earning less salary, because \"that's just caused by them choosing low-paying pofessions and at the same time hard or dangerous professions are filled with men.\", those people aren't saying what they say because they  don't want people to be equal, but because from their equalist perspective, *they already are*. \n\nThe reason why so many proponents of the \"equalism\" or \"humanism\" labels also happen to be critics of specific feminist theories about rape culture, or the role of the patriarchy, is exactly because they use the term as a way to criticize the very legitimacy of whether there are any specifically female issues still worth fighting for. \n\nBasically, their idea is that if we would drop the *specific issues* out of the picture,  and look at whether any minority is institutionally oppressed, they could just declare \"nope\". Limit equality to a formal legal equality, and drop the subculture-specific studies about what effects certain specific bigotries have. \n\nIt's the same logic as with \"Gay men are not discriminated, I don't have any right to marry dudes either! We are subject to the same laws! We are equal! And don't talk me about how these people need any *special* attention, because that would already be inequal in their favor\".  ",

There are generally accepted rules of war, and targeting civilians is considered off the table. Curtis LeMay, who was very involved with the Pacific theatre during WWII, once said to Robert McNamara that if the US had lost the war, he was certain he'd have been tried as a war criminal. McNamara agreed, and went on to write about the incident, adding, \"But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?\"\n\nAllow me to quote [Leo Szilard](http://members.peak.org/~danneng/decision/usnews.html), a man much smarter than myself, on this topic:\n\n&gt;Let me say only this much to the moral issue involved: Suppose Germany had developed two bombs before we had any bombs. And suppose Germany had dropped one bomb, say, on Rochester and the other on Buffalo, and then having run out of bombs she would have lost the war. Can anyone doubt that we would then have defined the dropping of atomic bombs on cities as a war crime, and that we would have sentenced the Germans who were guilty of this crime to death at Nuremberg and hanged them?\n\n&gt;But, again, don't misunderstand me.

They sucked, they were horrible, and we need to keep talking about them because (a) we need to devise better solutions to conflict and (b) both sides are human, and the way we deal with horrible things is to talk about them."

    "rejected": "&gt;In order for a literal interpretation of Genesis to be correct, at least one of the following must be true\n\nYou have to keep in mind that literal interpretation of Genesis does not necessarily mean you are a young earth creationist.\n\nOne interpretation is that Genesis 1 is not an account of physical/material creation. (This is actually the interpretation which I agree with.) Genesis 1 is an account of functional creation. Assigning purpose/function by God.\n\nIf you are interested in this Christian creation story, I'd recommend reading *The Lost World of Genesis One* by John H. Walton. He explains that ancient cultures were not concerned about the material existence of something, they were concerned about the function. For example, in our western world eyes, a chair is created when the pieces are all assembled and we can see that the chair physically exists. In many ancient cultures' perception that chair isn't created until someone sits in it (i.e. until it is actually fulfilling its purpose).\n\nThis interpretation takes Genesis 1 very literally and does not mean the world was created 10,000 years ago. The world was created millions of years ago, but God didn't put it into its intended function until the time of functional creation which is told in Genesis 1. This may be something you disagree with and you may ask \"well then what is the earth's intended function/purpose?\" But that is a different discussion. My point is that, depending on the interpretation, Genesis 1 does not say the world is 10,000 years old, even if it is taken literally."

    "prompt": "Democracies should not prosecute ex-leaders for crimes in office.",
    "chosen": "Your argument may be true in first or second generation democracies where there are still aftershocks of the transition from a harsher form of government, but it sends entirely the wrong message in established democracies. In a real democracy, peacefully handing over power is the absolute baseline expectation, you don't get any reward for doing it. To start seeing it as a favor the president does to his successor is to poison the system.\n\nSecond, I know presidents are often \"commander in chief\" and have some control over the military, but they do not have the power to be tyrants. They are not above all law, and do not have legal power once their term expires. An elected president in an actual democracy could not just mobilize the army and keep themselves permanently in power. Also the checks and balances of a democracy are supposed to keep leaders from doing things they would be prosecuted for. Prosecuting leaders who cross the line is part of how we send the message that \"these things are not ok from our leaders.\"\n\nFinally, consider what behavior you incentivize by granting full immunity for departing leaders: They have literally no reason not to be as vicious as possible while in office, including doing terrible things to stay in office, because they will receive a full pardon. It's why it's so important that international courts start prosecuting dictators and warlords. Egypt is a really bad example of a democracy, considering Mubarak was president for 30 years by winning races in which he was the only candidate, and he had a habit of imprisoning dissidents without trial. He was ousted by violent revolution, which generally is unnecessary in true democracies. In Egypt's case it might be worth granting pardons in the name of peace, but that was not a case of a democratic handover of power.",

No citizen in my country (Germany) would ever agree on exempting about 2060 mayors and many more 'leaders' of countys and states from the law they have to represent.\n\nLets get into some detail about what the President is: he is the head of the executive branch of a democratic **Republic**. It is important to note that the concepts of republic and state of law or Rechtsstaat in german imply that the law is above the people is some sense and everyone has to play by the rules.\nThe executive branch is the branch executing the law.

People granted the legitimation by the people they have to represent must be held accountable for every offense that would be an offense if commited by any of said legitimators. Otherwise I dont see a point in having a representative. I want someone who works and behaves by the same values and norms that I view as fundamental to my- and his or her- nation and state. \nIf getting elected means you dont have to face consequenses for your actions regardless what those are the whole purpose of getting people into office to execute the law in a direct and fair manner is void.\n\nWhile I agree that a peacefull transition is important for a working democracy I think that showing accountability is more valuable.\nI dont know about the voting rates in the US. The last time they were around 50%. This means that people dont give a shit about politics.\nIf we took the step and proposed that everyone in office would be held accountable for every offense while in charge ( and before obv.) I think politics would be more appealing to those of us who play by the rules and are pissed of by the government that can do seemingly everything without getting to face cosequenses for their actions. The example of Egypt is not so great in my opinion because the real power lies in the military the entire time. At no point in time the military lost power over the nation.( due to US funds, thanks Obama, thanks Bush, thanks Clinton, thanks another Bush.) \n\nSo its not that big of a deal to convict and punish \"leaders\" who are more like puppets. \n\nIf a nation wants to preserve its national integrety it has to show that it honors its own rules. And the people standing for that nation are the leaders. If people had free reign over what is right and what is wrong other nations would question the ability to act purposefully and responsible in international affairs. If your own laws dont mean anything to your international treatys might not too."

If trauma can manifest *after* the fact, then there might be no reasonable way of protecting the animal except to ban bestiality in its entirety.\n\n2.

Most people would consider this as a form of rape. This problem is exacerbated when it comes to animals. There is not really any way to clearly communicate between animals and humans to do any consenting. Sure, maybe you can try to \"assume\" the animal is consenting because it isn't resisting, but some animals just stay really still out of fear. Even if there's no readily apparent physical harm, there can be psychological harm, which is much harder to gauge. I've seen dogs that are very submissive because they've gone through abuse, but it's often hard to differentiate between those who are naturally submissive or forced into submission, especially when it happened at a very early age. I suppose you could argue that the animals themselves might be the ones initiating the sex, but also remember that there is a huge power imbalance. Animals are not humans, even if they may have some human characteristics, and they do not think or respond as we would. We are *much* smarter than animals, even more so than children. We can sometimes literally condition them into what we want them to be (a more extreme version of teachers or relatives \"conditioning\" children to love them in a sexual way). So unless there comes a different species that is equally as smart as us and makes similar thought and behavior processes as us, sex with animals will never be moral."

The power of this \"god\" was added to by its intense organization of the people who were responsible for it.  \n\nTo show that nationalism isn't fundamentally evil, we can have a look at what happened in Scotland over this last week.  There was a peaceful discussion, a peaceful referendum, and a peaceful aftermath as the result of a pro-nationalism movement.  In this case, there was nobody made out to be the real enemy, and nobody was hurt.\n\nWhat makes something go bad is fighting more against an enemy than fighting for a cause.  Here are some examples of some institutions and their enemies: Islamic State and The West/Western World, Communism and Wealth, and Reactionary Christians and Satan.  Possibly having an enemy isn't a bad thing, but when you make that bad thing your focus and start to group anyone who doesn't side with you as against you.  \n\n*All of those groups have made the hatred of their enemy their source of power.  When that is the case, the more enemies the group has, the more powerful they are.*  \n\nThat's it, really.  Anything (not just a religion) can go bad if it focuses on its enemy.  "

There's really few moral issues at stake as far as how much a pencil costs.  If the price of pencils goes way down to the point that manufacturers can't make a profit, some manufacturers will switch to other products (in turn, bringing the supply down, allowing the price to go up, and allowing others to stay in the business.)  However, if the price of human labor goes below what a human needs to survive, the human can't switch to being a tree or a rabbit.  There's a minimum that people need to survive regardless of what the supply and demand for labor currently is.\n\n3)  The concerns about a higher minimum wage costing jobs is exaggerated.  Businesses generally don't give out jobs as charity.  If a place that has 10 minimum wage workers can make more money with 9 instead it would have already fired someone before any minimum wage increase happens.  In reality, just a small increase in price will usually make up for any minimum wage increases.  This is very possible because...\n\n4)  Increasing minimum wage increases demand.

Shouldn't companies be required at the very least to pay enough so their workers aren't on welfare rolls as well?  McDonalds customers benefit from the fact that the employees aren't starving and looking like they sleep under a bridge, and the owners benefit $$$ as well.  Giving welfare to full-time workers is essentially just a subsidy to business.  I say let the customers and owners of a business be responsible for paying enough that their workers aren't miserable, barely surviving wrecks of human existence instead of making the taxpayer fill in the gap.  If you want a hamburger served by someone who has had a meal and a shower in the last week, I shouldn't have to pay for that.

    "prompt": "The USA is not a real democracy if the people of Guam, Puerto Rico and other island territories do not have the right to vote for their leader",
    "chosen": "They do have the right to vote. With the weird exception of American Samoa, people in the four outlying territories have the ability to participate in all elections in the United States. These islands elect their own governors and legislators, and even compete in the presidential primaries. They cannot case votes in the Electoral College, because they are not states, BUT if any of these citizens lived in a US state, as American citizens, they could participate in presidential elections, meaning they are not discriminated against ethnically, but geographically.\n\nBut, that might not be a bad thing when you think about it. In order for these territories to vote, they would have to become states, due to the Electoral College. In Puerto Rico, the issue of statehood is deeply divisive and some desire it, while others want to maintain the status quo or full independence. There is no concensus and forcing statehood upon them doesn't seem very democratic. Also, consider the fact that the states are actually indivisible. According to the Supreme Court in Texas v White (1869), a state cannot unilaterally secede from the union. Imagine if when we colonized the Philippines, we decided to turn them into a state in order to protect our democratic values, despite the fact that the people there overwhelmingly did not want to be a state. Sure, now they can vote, but they're trapped in a union they don't want. This relates to the current situation, because these territories may not wish to remain part of the United States in the long run and in the meantime should be allowed to determine their own futures.\n\nThere are a lot of flaws in our democracy. This might be one of them. The Electoral College also seems like one; it resulted in four presidents who didn't receive a plurality of the popular vote. But then, so is the Senate. Why should California and Connecticut both have two senators. That gives people in smaller states waaayyyy more of a say than those in larger ones. There are only two states where prisoners can vote. We don't require Election Day to be a paid holiday. What about teenagers? Don't they have rights; why can't they vote? What about foreigners? If voting is an inherent human right can we really take it away from people just because of their age or nationality? Even the fact that we elect representatives in a republican manner instead of having direct Greek-like participation, theoretically makes our democracy weaker.\n\nMy point is that you could say similar things about any democracy in the world. In spite of all this, the United States, Canada, Western Europe and a few other countries are consistently ranked as the highest-quality democracies in the world, by any international standard. If your concept of a \"real democracy\" doesn't include the United States, either real democracies don't exist, or your standard is wrong. I would argue the latter. The US may not be perfect, but perfection is impossible. Every democracy has some reasonable restrictions on who is allowed to vote. Some of these should likely be reformed, but in the meantime, that doesn't make the state any less real of a democracy. There are undeniable measurable differences between the world's electoral democracies and its authoritarian states and it is inaccurate to state that the former do not exist.",
    "rejected": "Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands residents actually **do** have the right to vote, its just that their representative in Congress can't do roll call votes in Congress, nor do they have any electoral votes for President since its based on representation in Congress (more on that in a second). They have the full right to vote in local elections, and can freely vote in presidential elections if they have residency in a US state. So the issue with these territories is more about Congressional representation more than anything.\n\nThe problem arises though because Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Marianas all have relatively low populations. Guam has the most with 160,000 people while the Marianas have only 53,000 people. In total the Pacific territories have a population of 270,000, half of the least populous state. The US Virgin Island's population is only 109,000. So giving these territories the usual 2 senators and 1 house member isn't justifiable given their populations are so much less than US states.\n\nPuerto Rico is unique among the US territories in that it has a much larger population. But the problem with Puerto Rico is that Puerto Ricans are divided on what, if anything should be done next. Some want statehood, some want a free association, some want to remain a commonwealth, and a few want total independence. There was a status referendum in 2012, but there were issues with the questions on the ballot. It left off choosing to remain a commonwealth as one of the choices. Past status referendums have always included remaining a commonwealth as a choice, and that has always been the most preferred choice. A third of ballots were left blank in protest for the wording of the questions. So even though there was a referendum in 2012, it's still not clear exactly what the majority of Puerto Ricans want in regards to their status. If a majority (or at least plurality) of Puerto Ricans are ok with the current situations, then what's the issue?"

They did not advocate Senator Clinton's election or defeat; instead, they proposed a commercial transaction — buy the DVD of The Movie. See WRTL, 127 S. Ct. at 2667; 11 C.F.R. § 114.15(b). Although Citizens may therefore run the advertisements, it complains that requirements of § 201 and § 311 of BCRA, 2 U.S.C. §§ 434(f)(2), 441d, impose on it burdens that violate the First Amendment.\n\nCitizens United was complaining that it was subject to the disclosure requirements and disclaimer requirements that campaign finance law then imposed.\n\n&gt;Section 201 is a disclosure provision requiring that any corporation spending more than $10,000 in a calendar year to produce or air electioneering communications must file a report with the FEC that includes — among other things — the names and addresses of anyone who contributed $1,000 or more in aggregate to the corporation for the purpose of furthering electioneering communications ...\n\n&gt;Section 311 is a disclaimer provision. ...  For advertisements not authorized by a candidate or her political committee, the statement \"____ is responsible for the content of this advertising\" must be spoken during the advertisement and must appear in text on-screen for at least four seconds during the advertisement. ...  In addition, such advertisements are required to include the name, address, and phone number or web address of the organization behind the advertisement.\n\nNow, Section 201 would not apply to Farenheit 9/11, since it was produced by a for-profit movie studio, and thus would have no contributors.  Section 311 might, but is frankly I think fairly tolerable.\n\nCitizens United was allowed to air the movie and ads for it - they just didn't want to disclose their donor list.\n\n",

    "chosen": "In addition to the other comments being made here one thing you should consider is why there is no demand for the jobs being entered in the humanities. We can make some grandiose statement about the market being always right, but it is well documented in research for instance that the market undervalues long terms benefits as compared to short term gains. Additionally when it comes to funding, occupations that have highly localized benefits are much more likely to receive a payoff.\n\nThis leads to the massive underfunding of many fields. For instance while philosophy has been directly responsible for the vast majority of changes in societal structure that have allowed us to succeed, this benefit is both long term and spread among the population making it unlikely that any specific philosopher will receive their due. This happens in the STEM fields too by the way. Researchers doing basic research often get a much smaller proportion of funding when rated against there contribution.\n\nSo for someone who graduates with a degree in philosophy and complains that there are no academic jobs available, they could justifiably be claiming that our society has poor values in what they fund just as a scientist who can't get an NIH grant due to cut backs can rightfully complain that society is being short sighted.",
    "rejected": "Why do you believe that people pursue these degrees?\n\nMaybe, if you understood why people intentionally chose majors with less applicable use in private industry, you wouldn't be so frustrated with their complaints.   \n\n\nOne of the reasons that these people feel entitled to their desired occupations in an oversaturated market, is that they were only ever told that they \"could do it if they wanted to.\" That's it. No intense career advice, no special programs, no parental discipline, and especially no market realism.   \n\nAnother reason that people major in the humanities and social sciences is NOT because of a natural disability in physical sciences, or possibly even a natural dislike for the subjects. Post-Cold War America's trend of increasing demand for technological skills and better equipment has not changed, however, the government sponsored push for quality educational tactics and funding most definitely did.   \n\nYou see, the arms race with the Soviets included not only nuclear warheads, but a struggle to produce the biggest bunch of smartest technical minds that the superpowers could extract from their populations.  Educational funding was at all-time highs between the fifties and the late eighties. Math and the sciences were rigorously applied in public school curriculums. Students had to work harder because teachers had better incentive and funding to allow for time and better programs.  \n\nThe sad truth is that teachers today are less skilled and have less time due to low incentive granted by educational funding in the US. Math and Science, being complex to learn for most without guidance, are easily given up on without heavy teacher encouragement. Instead of concentrating harder and working to pass classes, students may give up on their abilities to perform this work at an early age. Most people are afraid of math and science because, at a tender learning point, they were abused with poor teaching, impatience, and little guidance to understand how much they would need these skills later in life.  \n\nPeople are smart. We are curious. We also have emotions and egos. We want to learn, and if attempting to learn math and science is made too difficult, people will turn their attention to social sciences because they come a little more intuitively. Then they will wrap their egos around these subjects and think that this is where their skills lie. That is how the market for these professions became especially oversaturated in an increasingly technical world.  \n\nCan you imagine how hard that must be for these people? Everything they thought they could do, that made them special, all seems untrue now, and they *have* to blame it on themselves. Who else can they blame it on, society? But really, they can.   "

If a restaurant doesn't know offhand for some reason then a calorie counter should be able to know enough to make their own estimates.\n\n&gt; not the type of person who would stand to benefit the most from having immediate calorie information as they make their decision\n\nWhat makes you think that these people care?

I've got a few local favorite places and I could order the same thing three times and get something slightly different every time in terms of ingredient ratio, serving size and what the recipe is.  So using software assumes this is all completely constant and never changing...this isn't the case.  Do you add a +/-10% on each label then to account for this?  Audit all your menu items monthly to make sure they comply?  What a hassle for an inaccurate answer.\n\n&gt; but the average consumer doesn't have a firm grasp on these concepts, and calories are at least a start\n\nThen the answer isn't to force restaurants to post detailed nutritional information or to even post calorie counts.  The answer is to educate people about what things are healthy or not, and how to gauge a menu item on their own.  Teach the importance of what those numbers actually mean rather than \"well we're forcing you to label that this has 10g of Vitamin A\".  Well is that good?  Bad?  Meaningless?  What?  Labels are useless if no one knows what they mean.\n\nSo let people do the legwork themselves if they care.  If you think we should do this to make people care you first have to teach them *why* they should care.  Not shove numbers in their faces and keep saying \"higher is bad!\"."

When he gets Eve to eat the apples (though Satan isn't even mentioned in Genesis but as we are going to speak from an area that you are mostly ignorant except for the selective areas that support your opinion and yet have formed a decisive opinion) it is not because he wishes her to receive greater knowledge of science and logic or whatever. It is because he is envious of the paradise they have been granted when compared to his residence in hell. \n\nIf we take moral judgement to be based on intention, not on outcome (see Kant and the Categorical imperative), then, as Satan's intention is the will to destroy which fails miserably under the Universality Principle (if all were to follow the same goal the outcome would be bad), we must judge him to be immoral. Admittedly God works for the 'greater good' which is also un-grounded under the Catergorical Imperative he has also performed redeemable actions (heeling the sick, raising the dead, feeding the hungry, freeing people from slavery, providing water to those without, saving the Jews from persecution, creating a paradise, sacrificing his son to redeem mankind) which place him in a much more preferable place than Satan.

But this is the thing so important that supposed linguists suddenly crawl out of a hole and rally to validate, as if shift by metaphor obsoletes the vehicle word's meaning from the time the metaphor was made (like if \"mouse\" were exclusively used for the electronic device) and/or destroys the presence of a metaphor (like saying since mice is an accepted label for electronics, it has somehow shed the metaphor that earned it that label.)\n\nI've used this example before:\n\nDigital once referred to piano.  Digital meant \"relating to fingers.\"  Digits, as in numbers, came about because we had 10 fingers, 10 digits, 0-9.  Digital as in electronic became common usage because digits, 0s and 1s, made up all digital information.  Ergo, my digital clock shows numbers using an electronic system.  My clock and my grand piano have nothing in common, nor in fact do my digital clock and my left digits have anything in common.  Yet, there is a distinct and when analyzed, obvious, chain of connections that shows how one word's meaning transferred through time to be used in a totally new way.\n\nWhile yes, 'gay' as in 'dumb', 'aggravating', or a scornful way of showing dislike or protest was born of homophobic origins, today, gay as in scornful has little in common with gay as in homosexual.  Certainly, some people will feel offended by the use of the word gay in a derogatory context toward anything, and that's understandable, as it has been used as a form of prejudicial speech.  However, it is not always meant to hurt gay people, as a group, and that should be realized.\n\n&gt;I've had acquaintances in life say in full seriousness, in response to a resentment of social engineering for systemic (and perhaps subconscious) prejudice written into parlance, that I'm thin skinned since intentions while communicating matter more than the selection of word and the circumstances surrounding that symbol used in a system of communication.\n\nGo to rural china and shout faggot.  Do it over and over and over and over again.  Yell it, scream it, hurl it insultingly so that all can hear.  What will result?  Most likely, nothing.  People in china don't ascribe the same prejudices to the word 'faggot' that you do.  Despite your obvious intent to cause pain and emotionally hurt, you fail because of awful word choice.  Now sure, part of that is your fault, but now lets change the analogy a bit.\n\nImagine you and a friend are talking, intending to offend as many people as you can.  Screaming and yelling 'faggot' so all can hear.  You two can understand each other just fine, you get it, you want to offend people.  Then all of a sudden, all of the people who were around you, who you were successfully offending, they disappear and are replaced, in an instant, with rural chinese.  These people cannot understand a word you say.  They may laugh and stare at your antics, but they don't understand a word you say.  That's neither your fault nor theirs, is it?\n\nNow once more, same situation, except that these rural chinese folk look exactly like everyone else, act exactly like everyone else, and you can't tell the difference between a rural chinese person and some other random stranger without specifically asking them.  That makes it really, really goddamn hard to effectively offend people, right.  For all you know everyone around you is a rural chinese person totally unaffected by your antics.  \n\nAnd now we bring the analogy back to reality, by flipping it on its head:  you and your friend are talking, ~~intending to offend~~ not intending to offend anyone, and by and large, most people will ~~be offended~~ not be offended by your actions.  However, its also possible that a ~~rural Chinese person~~ gay person (or SJW, or generally any other person offended by the use of gay as a pejorative towards random objects or situations) who looks and acts just like everyone else will appear and totally misunderstand what you are doing  and therefore ~~not~~ be offended.\n\nAre they to blame for that?  Hell no.  Are you?  Not really, its just that you are using words that each of you have different subjective meanings ascribed to.  That's fine, it provides breadth and life to language.  What it also does, though, is mean that people will be offended as long as we don't have an orwellian, newspeak style language in common usage, and I for one think that's a good thing.",
    "rejected": "The problem I see with your argument is that you assume any scenario of reassigning meaning to a word inherently references its original meaning or intent.  But under that logic, you leave no room for social evolution and the gradual rejection of outdated ideas- which is the very opposite of what you titled a \"regressive agenda.\"  Delegitimizing and even making ridiculous terms that were traditionally used to hurt people is a *good* thing, and ought to be encouraged.  I've addressed this elsewhere, here's part of another comment I wrote:\n\n\"Stupid\" and \"idiot\" were once offensive, but they're not anymore since they've become all but detached from their original meanings.\n\nIt seems to me the reason those words fell away from their original meanings is precisely because they were 'allowed' to be used in everyday ways when speaking to other people.\n\nIf there had been successful campaigns to end the usage of those words, instead of becoming inert, they would have retained the power to offend and hurt people. But instead, as society became more conscience of the negative effect those terms had on the people they had originally applied to, new clinical terms were adopted, and the offensive ones became unoffensive. For instance, there is no widely used insult that specifically references someone who is incapable of speech. And it is self-evident that no one means 'one who cannot talk' when they call someone dumb.\n\nFrom what I have seen, that seems to be the inevitable cycle of offensive terms or concepts. Here are the rough steps of what I mean:\n\n* There exists in society an ill-informed, insensitive, or discriminatory practice or attitude toward a specific group. (Racism, sexism, homophobia, treatment of mentally handicapped, etc.)\n\n* There are derogatory terms assigned to the group of people in question. (Nigger, bitch, queer, dumb/idiot)\n\n* Over time, society evolves to recognize the error (to put it lightly) of the practices or attitudes towards a group. The practices and attitudes gradually fade out as social awareness increases, but the terms remain as a reminder, and actually take on more offensive connotations, since the history they reference is now known to be repugnant and immoral.\n\n* Eventually the terms themselves become unoffensive, as their continued use becomes increasingly less relevant to their original meanings. This process usually starts within the group the terms originally referred to. They take ownership of the terms and alter the meaning for their own ends. For instance, the term 'queer' has lost almost all negative connotation, and is often used within the homosexual society as a reference to fellow members. This process is also happening with some subcultures of women and the term 'bitch,' and in black culture with the term nigger/nigga.\n\nThis is what I see happening with 'retarded.' I would argue that most people don't envision or reference a mentally handicapped person when they jokingly call someone retarded. South Park has a great episode that makes the same point about the word 'faggot.' Unless you're in the deep south (apologies for the generalization) chances are if someone calls you a faggot, they're not making fun of you for being homosexual.\n\nDoes this mean that I shouldn't have a filter and say potentially offensive words like these with wild abandon? Of course not. But I absolutely think I ought to be able to use those terms in the right context, around people that know my intent behind them. In fact, I believe that using those terms in a way not relevant to their original meaning is a positive thing, since it helps encourage the process I outlined above.\n\n*Edited for formatting*"

Murder victims nor people who committed suicide are around to hear jokes about murder or suicide. The argument boils down to the fact that you may not know who has or has not been raped given the prevalence of rape/sexual assault in society, and therefore should not joke about it as it may bring up traumatic feelings for the person. You don't joke about any of these things in polite conversation because you don't know who has been affected in your audience (either directly or indirectly).\n\nThat's what I found by googling around a bit. I think it is reinforced a bit because rape is always spoken about in a singular way that can be triggers for victims - \"rape is rape is rape\". Murder and suicide have a much wider linguistic spread of ways of talking about them *that may not trigger specific incidents*. For example, you can say \"I'm gonna smash his head in with a brick\" and that will only trigger feelings for relatives of people whose heads have been smashed in with bricks, which is a very small amount of people.

Yes, the types that get blitzed out of their minds are the easiest to spot around campus, and certain parties tend to be like that.

This can be a lot of fun, and does not result in \"Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically\" like you are concerned about. I suggest trying this! I, too, was always turned off by the people who just drank crazy amounts and acted like idiots, but had some very good times at smaller parties with friends and a few drinks.\n\nModerate alcohol consumption (being mildly drunk) has been a part of many cultures for thousands of years. It would be a shame to write all that off without trying it a few times. Maybe it's for you, maybe it isn't, but trying it a few times is not dangerous.\n\nI knew a few people in middle/high school who were kind of grossed out about making out with the opposite sex.

There, it's less about getting drunk and more socializing with people you don't necessarily see all the time (I worked in IT and didn't associate with many people outside of IT unless I was fixing their computer) and some moderate drinking acted as a social lubricant to ease the anxieties associated with chatting with a room full of strangers.\n\nI don't want to encourage you to drink at HS parties, or even go to them if they make you uncomfortable, but I do think that you shouldn't write off drinking entirely until you've tried an office party environment.

    "prompt": "There is no reason for me to oppose sweatshop labor in third world countries",
    "chosen": "First off, paying workers in the Third World more would not result in much of an increase in prices.  In your scenario, you are assuming a 100% increase in the cost of a shirt.  However, according to [this study](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=peri_workingpapers) done by University of Massachusetts which looked at garment production in Mexico, a 100% increase in workers wages only resulted in a 2-6% increase in the retail price of clothing.  So your $2 shirt would cost around $2.12 instead.  Clearly, the negative effects of supporting better working conditions are negligible to you.  \n\nSecond, what about positive effects?  There are some philosophical arguments to be made here.  From a moral standpoint, we tend to feel guilty and displeased when we see or hear about poverty, suffering, and exploitation.  Oscar Wilde discusses this in his 1891 essay [*The Soul of Man Under Socialism*](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/).  These negative emotions that tend to afflict us because of other people's poverty and suffering decrease our happiness; therefore, we have an incentive to solve these issues and gain utility from 1) not feeling bad about the existence of poverty, and 2) feeling proud that we helped solve these issues.  Thus, by helping people in the Third World not have to work in sweatshops, we can decrease our guilt and increase our pride and self-worth.  \n\nThere are also positive effects in direct material gains, in that improving conditions in the Third World make it less likely that our own economy in the West will suffer from unemployment.  The closer wages in the Third World are on par with wages in the First, the less likely it is that we see manufacturing and other solid middle-class jobs get offshored and outsourced.  These jobs are more likely to stay here, and thus improve our economy.  Even if you don't want or need one of these jobs, an improved economy will still benefit you in the way of reduced crime, more and better quality goods and services, better schools, better public services, and so forth.  \n\nThere are also positive effects in the political scene.  Improved worker wages in the Third World reduces the profits of the large multinationals that exploit these workers.  These are often the same multinationals that control legislation and lobbyists here in the First World, and lobby to try to erode worker's rights here, jump around environmental regulations, and [siphon taxpayer money to pay its own workers here](http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/04/news/companies/walmart-medicaid/).  Making them get less profit via improving workers wages in the Third World means that you are helping to reduce their power here, which again directly benefits you.  \n\n**TL;DR: You benefit from improving working conditions in the Third World by feeling better about yourself, improving your future employment prospects and the economic conditions of your country, and helping undermine the power that large multinationals have over your government--all for the low, low price of a 2-6% increase in the cost of your clothing.  It's a clear net benefit to you.**  ",

And there is also the 2ndary impacts of high unemployment: high crime (need to fund more cops and prisons), more dysfunctional families (need more counselors and court systems).\n\nTo clarify the economic cycle: 1. Large corporation lays off middle class American Workers to increase profits.  2.  Americans lose jobs and go on unemployment and welfare.  3.

If you want an examination of Congressional gridlock in historical context, pick up Robert Caro's *Master of the Senate*, about the Senate career of Lyndon Johnson. It explains, in a lengthy prologue, how and why the Senate is a dead weight that inhibits progress or indeed most useful legislation. Senatorial intrasigence was a \"feature\" to the founding generation -- not a bug. \n\nThere are certainly reasons to second-guess that determination today. And there have been for centuries: Senatorial delays kept the poor poor during the Gilded Era, kept blacks from meaningfully exercising their right to vote until 1965, and arguably left America under-prepared for World War II.\n\nSo let's say I agree with your goal -- making the Congress more responsive and efficient is a good thing to strive for. It doesn't follow, though, that a \"reboot\" is the way to do it. First, as [I and others have told you](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2zpo9g/cmv_a_congressional_reboot_would_breathe_new_life/cpl7vp4?context=3), it's patently unconstitutional.

For every extremist you'd kick out with a \"clean slate\" rule, you'd likely just get a similar extremist, but one without the experience and expertise that (sometimes) comes with seniority. If gerrymandering is not to blame -- and some well-regarded left-leaning think tanks [make that case](https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/why-gerrymandering-doesnt-explain-congressional-extremism-%E2%80%94-and-masks-real-problems) -- then shifts towards the \"nationalizing\" of local races, and the eradication of cross-cutting cleavages, **are**. Let me explain that last part. Until about 1980, social conservatism and fiscal conservatism did not necessarily go hand-in-hand. You would see congressmen who were hostile (or at least apathetic to) civil rights -- like Sam Rayburn -- but who were fire-breathing anti-business *conservatives*. Those issues no longer cut *across* the ideological spectrum: now, if you're a social conservative, you're likely also anti-business regulation. All of this means candidates benefit from reinforcing prejudices, especially where money is involved,^[*] and as a result, Congress is going to end up reducing to extremist, warring factions, term limits or \"reboot\" notwithstanding. \n\nWorse still, by throwing \"the baby out with the bathwater\" and purging the whole Congress, you would get rid of the few experienced, highly-effective representatives who actually can cut across ideologies. For every Tom Cotton you'd lose, you would also lose a Chuck Schumer. Institutional \"brain drain\" is hardly likely to result in a better legislative process. \n\nI don't mean to make this problem sound unsolvable. It *is* solvable, but the solution is difficult. That solution is, *just elect better people goddamn it!!!!!!* To go back to Caro and Lyndon Johnson, during LBJ's tenure as Senate Majority Leader, shit got done. It might not've always been good shit, but that shit *did get done*, in large part because LBJ's overriding ambition always trumped political causes for him. Toss out divisive ideologues -- who are mostly ineffective -- and elect good legislators. That will solve the problem. It also might be the only solution. \n\n(That, and campaign finance reform. See asterisk)",
    "rejected": "I get your motive, but your method is unconstitutional.  And I say that not as a purist, but as someone who thinks our government would be fantastically better if we simply followed the requirement of representation written into the constitution itself.\n\nSimply put, we need MORE people in Congress. That sounds bad, right?  Except that voters are vastly unrepresented in the House of Representatives.  Basically, [in 1929, the house limited how many members could be elected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapportionment_Act_of_1929).  So in a growing country suddenly thrown into tumult by the depression, with the rich reeling and the poor mobilizing, elected officials moved to lock in their advantages by capping the number of representatives and allowing for jerrymandering of electoral districts. \n\nBy increasing our representation, we'd find several advantages: \n \n1) small districts mean that you might actually influence your own representative and your vote would actually matter.  not only would the representative have constituent representation as a legit electoral strategy, but it would be a whole lot easier to listen to a small constituency.  the result, closer adherence to the will of voters and more new ideas being introduced to help solve local issues.\n\n2) a huge House of Reps would be a huge mess, but in a good way.  Big money politics would be exceptionally difficult, as the house would become dynamic and complicated.  Basically, they'd be harder to bribe and influence.  \n\n3) Complex coalition politics and broken party discipline.  with 1000s of representatives, we'd have a messy, shifting party system again, with lower party discipline except around the key issues of the day.\n\n4) a more powerful congress and a weaker presidency.  with more representation, congress would be more responsive to constituents, a more legitimate seat of power, and could challenge the imperial presidency (ie, the strong presidency with authoritarian leanings that's evolved under Bush and Obama).\n"

Having all of the musicians giving the *same* emphasis is important, and what separates performing a solo from performing as part of a group.  \n\nSoloists give emphasis, accents, and modified timing wherever they feel it is right.  Members of a large group must give up that power to one person or else the music is either a muddled mess or else just dry and sterile.\n\nEDIT: Also, speed of light vs. speed of sound.  I'm not in a professional choir, but 10m is all it takes for the lag caused by the speed of sound to be noticeable for me.",
    "rejected": "Written music actually isn't terribly precise.  There are a lot of subtleties that can come in, ranging from strength or tone of attacks, how quickly you crecendo or taper off, how much you slow down, etc.  Even in a solo performance, there's quite a bit of room for interpretation.\n\nWhen you scale up to a large group of musicians, the issue is compounded many times over.  The different musicians will each have different interpretations, and they sit in different parts of the stage, which influences how they hear the music.  The conductor is the one who makes the ensemble work together to work toward a single interpretation of the piece.  \n\nAlso, professional musicians watch their director quite closely.  My most advanced musical experience was playing in a university orchestra, but we had a few world-famous guest conductors.  You did NOT make the mistake of letting them catch you not paying attention.  Even when you're looking at your music, you are tracking the conductor in your peripheral vision.  You don't have to stare at them at every second, but you watch for your cues in the tricky bits, and you watch for direction regarding volume, intonation, phrasing, etc.  A good conductor keeps the entire piece in their head, and they relay an incredible amount of information to the ensemble.\n\nAlso, why on earth would having a conductor only be useful if they are the writer?  Different conductors have different interpretations of different pieces, and to the practiced ear, there are incredible variations between different performances even of \"long established pieces\".  There isn't a single Platonically ideal \"correct\" version of the song.  That's just a part of how musical performance works."

I certainly won't argue that it is just the fault of feminists either though.\n\nThe truth is, both MRAs and Feminists have extremely unhelpful extremist elements in their midst that frankly need to be denounced by the mainstream of both sides. Feminists love to complain about Misogyny in the MRM, but ignore any misandry among their own, or even claim that it doesn't exist.\n\nI'm not just talking about feminists who want all men to die (and those do exist). There are plenty of popular mainstream feminist with views that would be called sexist if the genders were reversed.\n\nLike Anita Sarkisian, who blames school shootings on \"toxic musculinity\", or claims video games make us sexist. She is not some extreme outlier or straw man. The fact that she raised hundreds of thousands on Kickstarter alone shows how mainstream her views are.\n\nThe fact is, whether you agree or disagree with the MRM or its methods, there is a reason it exists. In many cases these are former feminists who felt drowned out or ridiculed when they tried to talk about men's issues. Instead of denouncing them, feminists should take a good, hard look at themselves and really question why these people don't feel welcome in their community.\n\nAnd there are issues were feminist are not only not acting on men's issues, but actively oppose equality for men. (#notall ofc.) Feminists have for example pushed for lighter sentencing for women, when they are already hugely advantaged in that respect.\n\nMany feminist push for woman quotas in male-dominated fields, which many feel would mainly result in more discrimination against men then less against women.\n\nI'm sure others could list more examples.\n\nThe fact is, it simply isn't a coincidence that the movement is called FEMinism. And despite its grand claims, most members usually behave according to the name.\n\nFeminism (complete with Patriarchy theory etc.) just isn't the answer to create equality for all, or else either the MRM wouldn't exist, or there would be a womens movement on its opposite. So you really can't just \"rebrand\" it intro egalitariansim and ignore the underlying issues. A movement for true egalitarian values has to show these values in itself. And feminism, even mainstream feminism just doesn't in word or deed.",

Reading men's rights campaigners such as Ally Fogg (who I would highly recommend), I see a battle for one of the few campaigners whose motivation is to improve the lives of men, rather than as a reaction against feminism, to find a collective he can work with. He is forced to spend almost as much time fighting MRAs as anti-male feminists, simply because he recognises that the way to achieve his equality aims is not to blame everything on women. My contention is that until the MRM can move on from the reactionary core that defines so much of its work, and recognise the value of feminism and the equality of women (which includes accepting the ways in which women are still disadvantaged), the idea that feminism should accept MRAs and concede to their perspectives would be a betrayal of feminism's most fundamental principles. \n\nSo, in conclusion, I agree with your suggestion of collaboration in principle, but the reactionary and misogynistic principles that make up so much of the MRM make this impossible in the short term.

No. Some of my coworker will probably tell you different, but it's not worth it to me. Internal theft (because if I don't charge you, that's what it is) is a huge problem in restaurants.

The Lancet medical journal published his results and the media responded.  The vaccine controversy was not started by laypeople.  It was started by a man trusted to be an expert in his field who lied to everyone to satisfy his agenda.  Given that the body of scientific knowledge is now vast enough that no one person can possibly be an expert in all of it, as evidenced by the fact that all of our best scientists specialize in very narrow fields, how else do we get information on scientific developments, if not from these experts?  And how would you go about teaching a layperson the necessary heuristics to determine when an expert is lying to them?\n\n&gt;Popularity boom of alternative and do-it-yourself medicine (much of which is disturbingly unregulated)\n\nThere is no evidence that homeopathy and alternative medicine is anything new.  Indeed, one can find a few dozen resources online describing a very storied history of snake-oil salesmen across the world.  As long as there has been anything one could describe as \"mainstream medicine\" there have been treatments considered \"alternative\".  \n\nThe Journal of the American Medical Association has a decent study available online on the topic, which goes into both the rates of use, and trying to determine reasons behind it.\n\nhttp://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187543\n\nTellingly, they report that nearly half of the practicing clinicians (47%) they interviewed had a habit themselves of suggesting and including methods considered alternative or homeopathic in regimens they prescribe to patients.  Again, this is coming from people we should consider experts, and not being generated purely by laypeople with a poor understanding of the subject.\n\nBuried in the study, they note that rates of use for alternative medicine are rising per capita, and suggest a correlation might be found between this increase and the rising costs of mainstream health care.  \n\nA report from the government of India, where alternative medicine is staggeringly popular, cites similar reasoning. \n\nhttp://www.dsir.gov.in/reports/ittp_tedo/ism/ISM_H_Global_Market.pdf\n\n&gt;Scientific \"controversies\" that largely exist only in the public sphere - i.e. Evolution\n\nAs /u/complete_misanthrope pointed out, this particular point is dependent on religious bias for life support.

In all of these cases, laypeople are not generating incorrect understanding about scientific works out of thin air.  They are either being lied to by people they have been taught to consider as experts, or they are being directed down these paths by experts with probably good intentions.  The problem has little to do with how we specifically teach experimental science in our classrooms, and a lot more to do with how we teach heuristics and critical thinking.

Some of them come from other comments, but I think it's worth collecting them all together and expanding on them, to make it clear exactly how many there are.\n\n* Regular wings are more versatile, and can cater to a larger number of preferences - boneless wings can only be served breaded because they're absolutely terrible otherwise. \n\n* Regular wings have a crispy fried layer of skin on the outside.  This is universally recognized as delicious, and is impossible to achieve on boneless wings.\n* Regular wings are made of darker meat, which is more flavourful and higher in fat.\n* If you select your wings for the health benefits, you're doing it wrong.\n* Regular wings are more consistent in quality - if I order a boneless wing, it could be a nice, fleshy (but still tasteless) piece of chicken breast, or it could be a blob of mechanically separated meat, mixed with fillers and coated in way too much batter (which is why they're cheaper, by the way.)  If I buy regular wings, I'm getting wings.  The worst that could happen is they're slightly smaller than usual, which can still happen with boneless, especially considering the amount of breading they often come packed with.  \n* Chicken, like most meat, is priced per pound.  This means that, even in the best-case scenario of large, meaty boneless wings, you aren't getting cheaper chicken based on the shape it's pressed into - but rather, based on the quality of the meat.\n* Bone-in cooking allows for more tenderness.  Boneless wings are either [a.] not as tender, or [b.] packed with fillers to help change the texture.\n* Why should you try to forget that you're eating an animal when you are, in fact, eating an animal?  If you think there's some sort of moral dilemma (which presumably is why you're having existential crises,) you owe it to yourself to face up to it, rather than avoiding having bones in your food.  This is for the same reason that any other morally-grey issue doesn't magically become better if you close your eyes and pretend it isn't happening.\n* There are ways of easily eating the chicken off the wing without expending very much effort.  Yes, it's still slightly easier to just bite into a boneless wing, I'll give you that one, but the difference is quite minimal - especially compared to all the benefits I've listed above."

    "prompt": "I believe that a catastrophic event that will change the face of humanity will occur in my lifetime. CMV.",
    "chosen": "I'd disagree with you for a large variety of reasons.  I will address each of your concerns individually, but I'd first like to say that major changes to the status quo rarely happen, if ever.  Also, these catastrophes are mostly regional and rarely (never?) reach a global scale.  That being said, let me address each of your points.\n\n1) This is an area in which I have great expertise.  I vehemently agree that climate change is a significant threat to the stability of the world economy and global ecosystem.  However, in your lifetime, it is HIGHLY unlikely that we experience rapid destabilization of either.  No climate model predicts the complete annihilation of the human race even in the long term.  In fact, in the short term (your lifetime), Russia is expected to experience a net gain in economic productivity due to increased fertility of some of their lands.  It was actually a huge issue when getting them to sign the Kyoto protocol. However, I digress.  Point is, short term cataclysmic disaster because of climate change is unlikely.  Regional disturbances will certainly happen, but people would adapt.  \n\n2)  This seems to be the most viable point.  However, I lived in Michigan when the huge blackout happened about ten years ago.  The blackout lasted a solid few weeks and there were some serious problems.  However, to completely disable the entire electrical grid of the entire country is damn near impossible.  Texas has their own electrical grid by itself!  There would have to be a major coordinated attack on each power plant in order for this to be even remotely possible.  Electric grids are getting smarter and aren't significantly prone to such a massive failure.\n\n3)  This has been a threat ever since WWII.  Each generation since then has feared of nuclear war.  I think almost every nuclear nation realizes that going down that path would result in mutually assured destruction.  It is not in anyone's best interest to pursue this as a war strategy.  I think you even seem to shy away from this point.\n\nYour catalysts are actually the most likely events to occur throughout your entire post.  However, the results of these would result in at best, higher income equality and peaceful government reform, or at worst, total revolution and civil disobedience.  The latter seems very drastic and Americans (I assume the catalysts are only focused on America) are far too comfortable with the current standard of living for that to happen within your lifetime.

I also hear that the situation is similar in other Romance speaking countries, like Portugal, Spain and Latin America and also Greece.\n\n&gt; -World War III: This seems the least likely, but the repercussions of North Korea's potential idiocy from a couple moths ago proved that it might not be that unlikely if one country makes one wrong move.\n\nIt's not just unlikely, it's downright impossible. Especially in today's globalized economy. No-one will profit from a global conflict these days, so no-one wants one to happen.\n\n&gt; -Telecom/electrical grid failure or sabotage: Our society would fall into chaos without these services, and if any were interrupted long enough, bad things would happen. Just really think about what would happen if the electrical grid throughout the US and Canada was just turned off for a couple of months.\n\nAny long-term destabilization of these services is impossible, considering the wide number of backup systems these same services run. The only way to do this would be an organized attack that starts on these backup systems first. Which would be a nigh-impossible task because, 1. There is a huge number of them and 2. By the time an attacker has taken down a fifth of these systems people would know what's happening, and how to respond to it. Also, keep in mind that telephone landlines are *extremely* hard to take down. And even then, if all these systems are taken down there is always ham radio and wireless to coordinate response, and these systems although fewer are even harder to take down due to the sheer decentralized nature of them.\n\nLet's take for example, Google, which is, in theory, just a private company. You can't take them down, period. Even if you manage to shut down one of their servers they'll have two backup servers up and running the moment you do. And these same servers are spreaded worldwide. It all boils down to \"too big too fail\" really.\n\nEven if there is a collapse, don't expect society to automatically fall into pure chaos and bloodshed, look at Japan. Hell look to me here in Argentina, we had a collapse not too many years ago (and we might just be heading to another but that's a whole other issue) and we surely did not degenerate into full blown civil war.

Its specifically the second part that is *heavily* influenced by factors such as technological advances. If we develop robotics and can do more work with fewer people, why does it matter how many employees it took to support the aging population? All that matters is that we generate enough food, medicine, housing, etc...\n\nAnd if we can find any other solution to caring for the elderly *without* unbounded population growth, wouldn't that be a better, more sustainable long term solution? Your proposed strategy of increasing the birth rate is going to make the problem even worse down the road, as we have to continue to ratchet up our population indefinitely.",
    "rejected": "This is actually a very common thing in developed nations. It is a phenomenon called [demographic transition.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition)\n\nBasically, when a nation's standard of living increases, people stop having as many kids. This is due to a few reasons.  When medicine isn't as developed in your country, you are going to have more kids both to have a greater chance of having at least some of them surviving childhood illness and reaching adulthood, and because much of the work in less developed countries is manual labor such as farming, and wouldn't you know it, kids are a source of free labor for you! \n\nHowever, as a country's economy improves, more opportunities become open to the individual. There is more education available to get into more specialized fields, with a large subset of the population waiting longer to enter the workforce.  Nations tend to become more liberal as they develop (not in every case, but for the most part this trend sticks), meaning women have more opportunities to do things with their lives other than giving birth and raising kids, causing lower birth rates. And since medicine is better in developed nations, one doesn't need to have as many children to try to continue your family line. Birth control is also more widely available.\n\nSo yes, the shrinking of birth rates in developed nations can cause some growing pains like the ones you mentioned (social security, an aging work force in an increasingly technologically advanced society, etc.), but this trend of demographic transition is reasonably predictable, so we can't exactly be surprised by it.  This just means that we must plan for the inevitable.  \n\nThe thing about demographic transition models is that it assumes the more advanced a society becomes, the higher the standard of living is. And, for example, this is definitely true in the US compared to where we were at 50 years ago. However, increasingly we are seeing income inequality become a problem around the world. The idea is that despite the social security system looking like its heading to its doom, as an increasingly prosperous nation, this shouldn't be a problem because when there are less people, the per capita wealth should go up, minimum wage should increase, and there shouldn't be as much need for social security. But this isn't what is happening and the average wealth is actually decreasing in relation to the cost of living.  \n\nThis leads us to possible outcomes for the future. If income inequality isn't addressed and the birth rates don't actually decrease, we could meet a terrible fate. This was the prediction famously made by Thomas Malthus, more or less, called the [Malthusian catastrophe.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe) Basically Malthus said that populations would continue to exponentially grow ([which looks like this](http://biology.unm.edu/ccouncil/Biology_112/Images/exponential.gif)) until our agricultural production couldn't keep up and the population would crash. However, there is a more optimistic possibility that says if we continue to develop and make sure that the standard of living raises for everyone in a society, our population will level off, meaning we hopefully wouldn't have to worry about things like social security. This kind of growth can be seen in [this graph.](http://14yunhyu.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/logistics.gif)\n\nThis is the hope for environmentalists, that the world will develop into a more equal global society which would naturally stabilize population growth, and then we can work on increasing our technology and minimizing human damage to the environment. \n\ntl;dr Basically, decreasing birth rates *can* be a problem, but they don't have to be. In fact, this can actually make our lives better. But we have to plan for this and ensure that income is more equal to not have serious problems facing us down the line. "

Tora! Tora!*. That movie is so factually correct that the 'historical accuracy' debates are mostly about the obvious bits (American carriers had to pretend to be Japanese ones, since the Japanese ones were on the bottom of the ocean), and some less obvious bits about which particular sub-model of aircraft was (or sometimes should have been) used as the basis for mocked up models used in the film. (That's why Michael Bay felt the need to go so far beyond the actual facts, he was trying to separate his film from the others, mainly from this one.)\n\nBut what happens in a case like this? You have a movie that's based on a true story, uses two different books as its foundation, was made with countless technical advisors, the stories of numerous American and Japanese battle participants, the full cooperation of the military to collaborate on complex (and massive) ship and aircraft movements... the works... and they still made mistakes. At what point is a production designer saying \"This engine cowling looks cooler\" different from a scriptwriter saying \"This battle seems cooler\"?

We should not be in the business of encouraging people to swallow stories wholesale, whether they find them in the theater, on the internet, in a book, or in the paper. If you are endeavouring to discover the \"true story\", you should already be looking at multiple sources. This isn't even a difficult thing to do - you managed to do it with a quick wikipedia search.\n\n\n\n&gt;People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can).\n\nHow someone interprets the word \"based\" is not the responsibility of the filmmaker. All the simulacrum in the world does not change basic definitions.\n\n\n\n&gt; If you want to learn history, want a documentary.\n\nWhile it's true that documentaries are often held to a higher standard than historical films, this does not make them infallible. A lot of what passes under the genre of \"documentary\" is heavily biased, or even outright doctored. Films do you the courtesy of letting you know they are fabricated, whereas any fabrication in documentaries is presented as unvarnished truth. Should we ban documentaries too?  \n\n\n\n&gt;\"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson\".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nBecause people are interested in history, but they are also interested in the human condition, and how people relate to one another. Sometimes, they would prefer this to historical accuracy. Pearl Harbour's main purpose was to tell a story of love in a time of war - the focus was on human drama, and not historical accuracy. It's perfectly fine to criticize them about this, but why would you get outraged over Bruckheimer being honest about his intentions? He *should* be coming forward to clarify that history is his backdrop and not his subject. I'd be more infuriated if he was *not* up front about this. \n\n\n\n\nI'm not going to say that people can't be easily misled, because they certainly can. But what is the alternative? 100% accuracy in all things? In many historical cases we can't even form a working consensus on what happened, or for what reason - that doesn't eliminate the ancient drive to tell stories about our history. If filmmakers want to be as accurate as possible they can - the Band of Brothers series comes to mind. But if they would prefer not to, and are happy to tell us that they are not even trying, what's the problem?"

After WWII, America was THE top dog. We controlled almost half of the entire world's economic activity because of various factors (one of which was that our competitors had all been heavily damaged by the war). Because of our overwhelming control of the global market, oil was incredibly cheap. And on our domestic front, more and more cars were being bought. Highways had already been under construction since the 30's, mostly for military transportation purposes, but this interstate road construction was HUGELY subsidized during the '50's. These huge sprawling roads were the most efficient use of resources at the time AS LONG AS gasoline was cheap and readily available. \n\nOil perhaps has a large pull, but it is largely because what we consider modern society was built on it. We've enabled ourselves to go without any real meaningful population-planning. We need a solution to the energy problem, but I don't think public transportation like high-speed rails really poses a threat to oil companies...cheap oil already kept the population spread out enough to make such public transportation (at least on a large scale) inefficient.

I graduated high school a few years ago and most of  the people I graduated with couldn't care less about learning anything, much less higher levels of thought. It wasn't because some vague corporate power was holding them down and forcing them into menial memorization of facts. Its because they couldn't be bothered to do the harder work that the school offered.\n\n&gt;The Corporate world whom have profited literally billions of dollars while effectively not teaching students anything (even within the paradigm of the education-factory system)\n\nThe corporate world does not educate us (at least most of us). That falls under the realm of state/local government control. These politicians receive far less corporate money, and have far more influence on education than the federal government (who recieves all the corporate $$) does.\n\n\nOn another note I think you may be creating a problem where there is none. I think we already teach too many frivolous classes that have no real world applications. As Dr. Bryan Caplan says in a lecture [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpk_u_VmPD4), I could be getting a college degree in finance but not graduate because I haven't taken a class on Aristotle. Which has no real applications, and is very unlikely to teach me any critical thinking that I haven't learned in the past 16+ years of school. I'll even go as far to say there is already too much non-job related teaching going on at schools and it is mostly a waste of time/money. Most of these frivolous classes (foreign languages and other unnecessary electives) cost way more than they are worth, and could be easily learned on the students own through the internet.\n\nIt comes down to people have to work, we can't all just sit around and collect money. So the best way to prepare people for that is to make their education related to some job they would enjoy in the future. Not everyone can own a business, be an entertainer or artist, or get outstandingly wealthy.\n\n\n\n\n#2\n&gt;Who consistently lobbies for lower taxation? The Corporate, that's who. The reason is fairly obvious -- if we give less money to the government we give more money to business.\n\nYou are creating a false dichotomy between big government / big business. They very often work closely together. Why else would corporations donate millions if not billions to campaigns nationwide? Government subsidies. There is no competition between government/corporations. They work in tandem more often than not.\n\n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm really tired of this narrative that Americans have it so bad off. We have the highest median income of any almost any country (according to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_household_income) we are fourth). Americans have the most widespread wealth and resources of any country on the planet. We're not starving, homeless, or on the brink of total financial collapse. Are there some people who have a lot more money than me (and presumably you)? Sure, but comparatively to people across the world and history though, we are VERY privileged. Could we improve? Most definately, we are in no way perfect. However to make it seem like we are really struggling because we have to stick with the iPhone 4s instead of upgrading to the 5 is a bit misleading."

I agree that if we look at ourselves from a perspective that ignores the limits of human life that everything is essentially meaningless.  That said, when viewed within the scope of our existence, it no longer becomes difficult to find meaning in things.  Our interactions an relationships with other people feel immensely meaningful; the connection between ourselves and nature -- the cyclicality of life, the dependence of all things on another -- inspires both beauty and meaningfulness in many people.\n\nMy point here is that perhaps you are looking at things on far too large of a scale.

I have no idea what your life is like, but I'm guessing many of your actions reveal that you find meaning in life on a smaller scale which exists immediately around you and includes yourself. For instance, you chose not to commit suicide today and have probably taken some efforts to remain alive (eating, drinking, etc.), and while one may chalk this up to simple biological self-preservation, you as a sentient being could choose a different route entirely. I'm also guessing you haven't gone out of your way to murder someone else or inflict pain on anybody innocent.

This is equivalent to saying that a judge's job is to uphold the law as written, not to reinterpret it the way they think ti should be; the police's job is to enforce the law is written not to apply their own best judgement about whether an action is 'really' a crime. Teachers are not entitled to change the outcomes of the tests given to our students. Those tests, wrongly or rightly, are there for accountability and circumventing that accountability says that teachers know better than the communities we serve. Let's be honest - we actually MIGHT know better than the community but that is ABSOLUTELY NOT our decision to make.\n\nTeachers can offer parents guidance in opting their children out of these exams. Teachers can refuse to administer these exams. Teachers can beg and plead or stand up and scream against these exams publicly and intelligently until the community realizes the mistake it has made by allowing these preposterous funding rules to continue. But cheating on the exams is not a valid form of protest; it is a dishonest attempt at circumventing the consequences that the community has chosen.\n\nNow, I know - the people who wrote NCLB do not have hungry kids attending broke-ass Atlanta public schools - they have smarmy rich kids attending private institutions or sterling public academies in wealthy districts. That is a Problem. But it is not a problem addressed by these teachers' actions. In the fight for justice for our students, the absolute worst thing that teachers can do it lie, cheat, and make ourselves look dishonest.

Thus, I can't really change your view, because neither the current view or the opposite is true.\n\nIf you're saying social media information SHOULD be admissible evidence, as someone else mentioned, there are no blanket categories of information/testimony that are always admissible (or inadmissible).\n\nThe underlying problem is that social media information, like many written statements, is hearsay (an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted).  However, the exceptions to the hearsay rule almost swallow the rule itself.\n\nFor example, statements made by an opposing party (the person suing/being sued) are typically admissible.  Thus, if there's no legitimate question that the account belonged to the person and that it wasn't hacked, we can assume that the person wrote the statement.\n\nNow you get into real problems if you're trying to use someone else's social media in court.  Imagine you're suing your neighbor for vandalizing your house, and the neighbor wants to introduce his best friend's facebook post from the time of the vandalism 'tagging' your neighbor at a movie theater across town.  Wouldn't you want to cross-examine this friend?  Wouldn't you want the jury to see how the friend reacts to the questioning?  How do we even know the \"friend\" is a real person and not a fake account?  Or that it wasn't modified after the fact?  Or a billion other problems.  Hearsay is about reliability, and there are exceptions to exceptions, so it depends on what purpose you're using it for, but you get the idea.\n\nSo circling back, I think the best answer to your question is that social media evidence actually can be admissible if it was posted by the opposing party, which is often what you care about (say, facebook posts by an ex-wife during a divorce action).  There are dozens of other times it COULD be admissible as well.  And for the rest of the cases, well, I'd argue you wouldn't WANT social media information to be admissible because it's just too unreliable - after all, we don't allow witnesses to bring their journals into court as evidence.\n\nSo in some sense, I would \"change\" your view in the sense that I bet you can think of 1000 situations where you wouldn't want someone's twitter feed to just randomly show up at a trial - who wrote it?  When? Why?  How do we know it wasn't edited later or just created 10 minutes ago?  People could make up anything they wanted, and in that sense, social media posts can be no different than a notebook in someone's house; anyone could write anything they want in there, but that doesn't make it admissible evidence.\n\n(Not legal advice.)",

Very little of what I post on social media is intended for all to see. Facebook posts are usually restricted to friends sometimes specific friends. When I use Google plus it's usually targeted to very specific groups of people. There are also the private aspects of those platforms like Facebook chat and Google Hangouts. \n\nI have no problem with public information being used, or information that a party to a case has and wants to bring as evidence. I have a bit of a problem with law enforcement trolling through loads of information that was posted as private or semi-private information just to see what they can find out. "

I, like many people, and I'm guessing you as well, feel that standardized testing is a waste when students could be learning far more useful skills and applying far more of their talents and abilities.  \n\nHOWEVER, the science on IQ testing is really well established: standardized tests correlate very well with IQ tests, and also with later educational achievement, and *also* with later success in careers, higher incomes in adult life, etc. Standardized tests are very predictive, almost scarily predictive. \n\nThere's an element to IQ testing known as [the g factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_%28psychometrics%29). What it is is a kind of abstraction that correlates all of the features of various IQ tests (memory, recognition speed, problem solving, logical analysis, etc.). Cognitive researchers hypothesize that it represents some general mental ability... perhaps something like mental \"energy,\" perhaps a general ability to focus. They aren't really sure what it is. \n\nBut what they are sure of is that the g factor is [quite predictive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_%28psychometrics%29#Practical_validity).  \n\n* the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50–.60, .40–.50, and .30–.40, respectively  \n\n* According to research by Robert L. Thorndike, 80 to 90 percent of the predictable variance in scholastic performance is due to g, with the rest attributed to non-g factors measured by IQ and other tests.  \n\n* Research suggests that the SAT, widely used in college admissions, is primarily a measure of g. A correlation of .82 has been found between g scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores.  \n\n* There is a high correlation of .90 to .95 between the prestige rankings of occupations, as rated by the general population, and the average general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees, the association between job prestige and g is lower – one large U.S. study reported a correlation of .65 (.72 corrected for attenuation).  \n\n* The correlation between income and g, as measured by IQ scores, averages about .40 across studies. The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age, stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education, occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant, the correlation does not vanish.  \n\n* The g factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems, such as dropping out of school, chronic welfare dependency, accident proneness, and crime, are negatively correlated with g independent of social class of origin.[68] Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to g, with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood.  \n\n**TL;DR: If you do well on standardized aptitude/achievement tests, you're at least 60% more likely to make higher than average grades, 80 to 90% likely to do well on the SAT, 90-95% more likely to become a doctor, attorney or business executive (or similar high-prestige profession), about 40% more likely to earn a higher income, and much less likely to have social behavior problems. Standardized tests are popular because they are disturbingly good at predicting your future.**\n\n",

If they can speak well enough and complete the course objectives, they pass to the next level.  If they can't, they have to repeat the course.  Its absolutely essential that they fully understand English 1 to continue on to English 2, since Level 2 assumes they know the material from English 1 and builds on it.\n\nThis is the same in every subject, whether it be math, science, history, etc.  It's hard to do calculus if you haven't passed algebra, the test is there to demonstrate that you know algebra well enough to move on the algebra 2, etc. If you take everyone's word for it that they understand, then some people will pass that don't really know the material, and they will *really* struggle in more advanced classes.\n\nHistory is a bit different, since its a social science, sometimes its just measuring facts, but more often, especially at the college level, it examines your ability to see underlying concepts of historical events.  Knowing when WWII started and ended isn't nearly as important as knowing *why* it started and *how* it ended, and what implications those had.

The whole line of space shuttles had outlived its useful lifespan in only 20 or 30 years because it would have been prohibitively expensive to upgrade them to modern standards.\n\nNow, when the space shuttle was initially designed and constructed it was the epitome of technology.  The U.S. government spent billions of dollars on the space shuttle program - most of the money that the U.S. spent on any kind of space program was spent on the space shuttle.  All that money has essentially been obsoleted by newer space programs (in particular, the private space company SpaceX).\n\nWhat if, instead, we waited for technology to advance to the point where space travel was easy?  Where building self-reliant habitats was easy?  You can argue that for these technologies to advance we have to start pushing space programs now, but I say using stepping-stone programs to advance the technology (and sometimes even getting private industry to do it instead, ala SpaceX) is a much more efficient method of reaching your goal than saying \"Ok, buckle down everyone, we're building a colony on Europa in 10 years!\".\n\nI believe, if we were to pour buckets of money into a space program again, whose purpose was colonizing other planets and/or moons, it simply wouldn't give us as much bang for our buck as if we wait for technology to develop to a point where it is both easier and more economical to build such a program.  And with the rate that technology is advancing, that point can't be far off (especially on geological/astronomical timescales).\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes things just take time to develop, and throwing as much money as it as you can right now (\"greatly focus on funding\") is not the most efficient way to do it.",
    "rejected": "The cost to make another planet livable would be immense, probably in the range of trillions to quadrillions of dollars. It would likely take centuries of investment from our planet to make it livable and functional.\n\nIf our earth break down in the next few centuries the colony will probably wither and die. We would do better making sure our planet is secure and safe from dangers first and then later when the technology is cheaper start colonizing. \n\nA trillion dollars spend building a colony on Mars would be wasted if we died from climate change and couldn't support our colony."

    "chosen": "I think your real issue is that you're conflating being privileged versus being racist. Being privileged and taking advantages of the opportunities afforded you because of your race/gender/income status is not inherently being a bad person or racist/sexist/classist. Yes, you have had to work to get to where you are in life. Everyone who has success in their life often feels that way but to ignore the fact that you may have been born with certain intangible advantages does border on ignorance to how society functions. Prejudice (conscious and unconscious) is not just your opinions and beliefs coded by your actions. It's also the culmination of other people's (i.e society at large) opinions and actions and no one is free from that. \n\nRacism (and other prejudices) exist in far more subtle forms now that are not as clear-cut as the KKK coming to drag families from their homes. [Consider this little social experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti5ZFmglzV4). While not the most rigorous of study designs, it is interesting to note the drastically different reactions you see here. Two subjects, one black and one white, are clearly being seen stealing a bike yet only the black person is directly confronted and harassed for it. \n\nAlso in regards to scholarships, [white people actually get a disproportionate amount of aid](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/09/06/merit_based_and_private_scholarships_disproportionately_favor_white_students). [Full Study Link](http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/20110902racescholarships.pdf). \n\nFor a more easily studied example of prejudice working against black people, look at sentencing statistics. [They are more likely to receive harsher sentences for the same crimes committed by white people](http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/rd_sentencing_review.pdf). [This disparity possibly even extends to early in life](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-03-06/report-school-discipline/53380620/1). \n\nI'm not looking to debate the strengths and weaknesses of these examples because I feel like that's going to take us off topic but regardless of how you want to look at it, willfully ignoring race as a societal force is ignorance. 50 years ago there were huge divides between black and white people coming from almost a century (100 years) of active marginalization and oppression and prior to that two centuries (200 years) of slavery. That's a huge part of our nation's history that shaped our culture and you don't wipe that out in less than two generations.",

Right?\n\nI mean, if it *wasn't* culturally-based, then you're looking for a way in which white people are biologically better, which is not what the concept of \"privilege\" is about.\n\nAnd look at the rest of your race: Your name, the way you were raised, your financial situation, and your education are *all* influenced by the color of your skin. You've had plenty of people pointing out the reasons why. Again, I want to introduce you to my friend Jamal. You *know* he's not white. And you know that your parents would *never* have named you Jamal.\n\nYes, *some* black people do as well as whites given the exact same names, upbringing, financial situation, and education. *That's kind of the point.* But even that isn't all -- those reasonably middle-class blacks who are doing just fine, and proving that the system is egalitarian after all? They're *still* more likely to be stopped by the police, still more likely to be convicted by a jury, and still more likely to experience more blatant forms of racism than you are.

The most insidious form racism takes these days is not explicit prejudice, but the situations and circumstances that maintain the very real inequality that exists between black people and white people -- like the fact that even if it was a justifiable call every time, the black person is *still* less likely to get that loan.\n\nIt's a huge cultural problem, and not one you can solve all by yourself.\n\nBut the first step is to be aware that it exists. There's no way a problem like this can be addressed if we're all pretending it doesn't exist, or that it was all solved 50 years ago."

    "prompt": "I believe that women's only hours at gyms are sexist and shouldn't exist CMV",
    "chosen": "Here's my perspective, as a man, and as someone who has gone to great lengths to understand situations like this from other people's point of view: To me, it seems to be about basic safety and comfort. A lot of women feel uncomfortable being physically vulnerable in front of men, especially men that may be more physically fit, if not totally ripped. Many women have to deal with the fact that men can dominate them easily, physically, at any point in time, and having to deal with that fear in a place where they are trying to become stronger and more fit isn't really fair. I've had the concept of \"rape schedule\" explained to me before, and to me, it makes sense; it's the idea that rape statistics are so out of control in this country (and in most countries; this isn't an \"America is the rapiest place ever\" thing), that many women feel they have to plan their lives around the conscious or subconscious fear of being raped or otherwise violated. It's just a fact of life for many women in this country, and it's a fact of life that does not dissipate as soon as one walks through the doors of a gymnasium. To that end, I absolutely feel that it's appropriate to have a women's only hour at the gym. Now, if the question is whether a men's only hour should also be instated, well, that's a valid point of discussion, but on the question of whether women should have a safe place to exercise and become more fit, more strong, and more physically capable, without fear of sexual judgment or objectification or god knows what else (considering these are fears many women have to live with for the other 23 hours of the day), I think that's a completely justified policy.\n\nEdited to add that of course, all of that having been said, the administration can and should do more to make the whole system egalitarian. My central point remains, though.",
    "rejected": "I agree they are unfair, but you have to realize almost EVERY inequality between men and women comes from one belief. And that is.......\n\nMen love sex. They can't control themselves. Sex is the only thing men want. Women don't like sex nearly as much as men. \n\nNow, obviously this isn't true. But it is a common belief held (to at least some extent) by most people. This is the reason men are praised for having sex and women are looked down upon. This is the reason female rape victims are taken a lot more seriously than male ones. And yep, you guessed it, this is the reason women have their own hours at the gym but men don't.\n\nAs a lot of other people have stated, women ogle at men at the gym just as much as men to to women. But because of this social stigma, this is thought of as \"creepy\" for a man to do but almost sexy when a woman does it (especially if it's to you). And because women are taught the whole \"men can't control themselves,\" they're basically taught to see men as threats. Men don't have this. That's why if a man is checking out a woman, especially if it's in a place like a gym, her immediate reaction is that he's a threat. He may hurt/harass her. That's when the term \"creep\" is used. Like I said, men don't have this. They don't feel threatened when women stare at them like that. They can go to the gym without worrying about getting this uneasy feeling that women do. That's why they don't need their own hours.\n\nSo yeah, it all stems from these gender roles. And odds are, you're contributing to them. So you can't fight one of the solutions to these problems created because of the gender roles because you think it's \"unfair\" if you aren't willing to stop contributing to the gender roles yourself."

I don't believe that religious views about this matter are as consistent as you think. Why should one Church's views supersede another's?\n\nAnd the word is entrenched in legal language as well as society. It means \"more\" somehow than civil union. I don't know why, but that seems to be the case. Separate but equal isn't actually equal, is it /u/slai47?\n\n",
    "rejected": "&gt; Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word mariage, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around 1200-1300 CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word marītāre, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious.\n\nThe word marriage is just a word. It isn't intrinsically *anything*. It means whatever we've collectively decided it means, and for quite some time now it's been used to describe a romantic union, especially from a legal standpoint.\n\nI don't care what modern religious people use for their words. That doesn't mean anything to me, since I am not religious.\n\n&gt; Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.\n\nThe government isn't changing the definition of anything. It's simply allowing gay people to operate under the umbrella of marriage like straight people already do.\n\nIf you're religious and you have your own definition for marriage, well bully for you! But that doesn't mean you get to own the word. It just means you have your own definition for it.\n\n&gt; Now I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.\n\nThis is wholly unnecessary. Religious people simply need to get over it, they don't own the word. If I want to buy two rats and give them a marriage ceremony and go around calling them married I am free to do so. They can't stop me.\n\nBut frankly, every time civil unions come up those same religious folks are against it. This \"debate\" isn't about the word marriage at all - that's just a way to make it look like your real problem isn't with gay people."

    "prompt": "I believe Batman is a terrible superhero and his praise is unwarranted. CMV",
    "chosen": "Hi I_STAB_HIPSTER_FILTH. I like your username and share your dislike of hipsters. So, I'm going to respond to each separate point to attempt to help you enjoy Batman. Here goes something:\n\n&gt;* He claims to stand for justice, but instead exerts base revenge. If he actually cared, he would be trying hard to make sure *no other child lost their parents* like he did. Somebody like a billionaire is in every position to do exactly that. But instead of cops getting bat-armor and bat-tanks, they get a man prowling rooftops and scowling.\n\nBatman does stand for justice. His drive is revenge-based, to some degree, I can agree with that, but what he wants to do is clean the city of villains so that no child will have to experience this again. As for funding cops, it's been established that the GCPD is filled with corrupt and lazy cops, not to mention all the crazy politics of the city.\n\n&gt;* On that subject, I wonder how well funded the mafia in Gotham is. He never has problems financing his exuberant vigilante lifestyle. I wonder if he could have, you know, hired every thug in gotham and offered them a million each for each don captured alive?\n\nWould you trust gang members to deliver? You have a good point, and this is similar to what he's tried to do with Batman, Inc using more trustworthy people.\n\n&gt;* On  the OTHER subject, I wonder just how many crimes CAN you witness from a rooftop?\n\nRemember that Gordon keeps the Batsignal for a reason. He calls Batman whenever he suspects something bad. Also, Batman goes on his own patrols and whenever he even gets a whiff of something fishy, he'll go all out on them. He is the World's Greatest Detective, after all. Not to mention all his WayneTech computer and satellite equipment and other equipment that helps him keep an eye on things.\n\n&gt;* Arkham is to villains like a wall is to the Kool-Aid man. In fact, it's debatable how many people die in Joker's escapes. In Kingdom Come, Lois Lane is one of them. If only a millionaire/genius/playboy/philanthropist built, say... [an unbreachable prison of sorts?](http://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pit-Fall.jpg) Relatively anyway. Anything better than 100% escape rate for every single criminal is an improvement. If that jail were a mailman, it would steal every letter.\n\nThis is true. But the concept was actually explored in Arkham City, which was brutal toward political prisoners. Remember that they still have to humanely treat the defenseless people in the prisons. And in all likelihood, political prisoners would likely be sent there, and the heavier types would kill them in something like a pit. Not to mention it's unlikely the US government would allow such a thing to begin with, though I don't know what the NSA will do.\n\n&gt;* As stated before, punching people after dark is a pretty awful way to go about dissuading crime. A real billionaire in a superhero universe would have funded an army of Judge Dredd-bots to patrol Gotham day and night to help cops. And to his credit, Bruce does just that in Kingdom Come... [*only after he is too old to punch people*](http://gallery.junbobkim.com/d/1315-2/10-comm-KC-Batmam-Inked.jpg). Anyone see a pattern?\n\nAgain, he's tried to some degree with Batman Inc and the technology may simply be tougher to create than expected. Besides, creating what could amount to a possible fascist regime is far from his MO. This could also incite fear and panic in the good people of Gotham who don't usually do much outside at night. That's why he usually works at night. To avoid scaring people who he is trying to protect.\n\n&gt;* I wonder how many thugs he \"interrogated\" used the fifth amendment? Just kidding, they all deserve more vitamin fist! Just like in the real world.\n\nTrue, but he won't kill them. He usually avoids causing too much injury. And it's not like most other heroes will sit with the thug, offer him a cup of coffee, and discuss things civilly.\n\n&gt;* A rubber suit a bullet stopper ain't. The best armor we have now weighs tens of pounds and ONLY trades a hole in the chest for broken ribs. Dumb plot armor is the reason he has not had a dental appointment with a bullet.\n\nThis is true, but to some degree the costume does incorporate such defenses. Also, WayneTech develops new technologies all the time, which help add more protection. It is a comic book, after all.\n\n&gt;* How many underage boys died on his fucking job again? Todd, Grayson, etc.\n\nIt's not like he ever wanted them to become Robin. He disliked the idea of placing a young boy, each of which at some point became his son, to begin with. Each Robin had to convince Batman that he could hold his own in a battle before he even let him help. They convinced him to let them help. They knew the risks and joined him, even though he discouraged them all from doing so.\n\n&gt;* Despite fanboys' bold boasts (that batman is undefeatable), his ass is broken by Bane in two different media, both of which could have gotten the world's greatest detective killed. But he is magically ok, and none the wiser. However, when Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) [is crippled by the joker](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y65ZgyuDiAM/TVgRJ5qErwI/AAAAAAAADLc/yuSOvHiFxzY/s1600/batman+the+killing+joke+babs+shot+-2+-+Copy.jpg), the world's greatest detective somehow forgets things like \"survivor guilt\" and just doesn't use his magic science to fix her spine. Because punching thugs is best done... alone...\n\nWell, I doubt he didn't try to help. Not to mention their injuries occurred differently. Batman had his back broken by direct force, Barbara was shot through the spinal cord and it was shattered (she is now Batgirl again since the New 52 reboot). As for being \"undefeatable\" this is an exaggeration. What they really mean is that Batman is a master planner, a brilliant tactician who attempts to think about everything he can. Because of this, he can think of a plan for almost anything with enough time.\n\n&gt;* He is lame: see, batnipples, batcreditcard, batplane shot down by revolver, bat-tango\n\nFor the love of all that is sacred, please, I beg you, ignore the campy, weird Batman versions. These were mostly an attempt to appeal to kids and be less violent, thanks to idiots claiming that grim comic books made kids violent (like what they say about video games today). This is why the (now defunct) Comics Code Authority ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority ) was established. Its overly stringent code virtually guaranteed that Batman would have to become campy or disappear for good. The 1966 Adam West show added to this problem later. Around the 70s Batman went back to his grim roots. The Joel Schumacher movies were a similar problem because WB wanted them to appeal to families.\n\n&gt;* He doesn't kill except when he totally does. In the movies alone, he leaves Ra's to die on the train that... oh yeah, plows down a city block. I hope no one was living there.\n\nI also ask that you not take the Nolan films, or the Frank Miller versions of the character as true to Batman. Batman will often go out of his way to make sure everyone lives. While the Nolan Batman was a great story, it wasn't very true to Batman as a character. Neither is Frank Miller's Batman, which the Nolan universe borrows quite a bit from.\n\nTo see the true Batman I recommend you read his comics from no earlier than the 90s. Especially the New 52 ones, since that's the current continuity. If you want good media, the Arkham games are fantastic and true to the character. The 90s Batman Animated Series, while taking a slightly less grim tone than the comics, was also very true to the character.\n\nFor me the appeal for Batman is that he's a normal human (in biological terms) who has trained himself to do great things. And more than that, Batman is kind of like a Bond villain in that he's a master planner with plenty of grand schemes. The difference is he's a good guy trying to help people instead of hurt them and he does have a strong sense of morality, like his anti-killing pledge. He isn't above doing the work himself. Also, he doesn't feel the need to laugh at his own jokes.\n\nI sincerely hope I've convinced you to reconsider your opinion of Batman and you give the real Batman material another shot.",

The other major problem is the massive, massive amounts of corruption.  If Bruce Wayne wanted to clean up the city, would it really make sense to continue the corruption by bribing people in power?  \n\nBruce Wayne is incorrigible.  He can't be bought.  He knows this.  This is why he, until he finds suitable allies (e.g. Commissioner Gordon) can only trust himself in the pursuit of real justice. \n\n&gt;On the OTHER subject, I wonder just how many crimes CAN you witness from a rooftop?\n\nPart of the mythos is that he has the technology to determine this sort of stuff.  This is kind of a nit-picky point honestly.\n\n&gt;As stated before, punching people after dark is a pretty awful way to go about dissuading crime...\n\nWhile a lot does come down to fisticuffs, most criminals aren't going to just let themselves be tied up and subdued.  So he has to kind of force their cooperation.  But again, going back to the previous point -- if there is a dude masquerading as a batman and he's rather good at stopping crime and he can't be bought out, that makes for a reasonable deterrent in a city that isn't used to a man like that.  \n\n&gt;A rubber suit a bullet stopper ain't.\n\nAgain, this is well explained -- it's not a rubber suit.  The fake technological stuff changes over time, but it's just highly advanced materials, not rubber.\n\nIdk, a lot of the other things you mentioned seem rather silly to take issue with because of the creative license that comes with super heroes.

So since it's a movie and they're telling you outright it's a dramatization then there's no reason to go through the song and dance of verifying it as 100% factual.  Things that are 100% factual would be a documentary, which these movies are not advertised as.\n\n&gt; Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth'\n\nBut the tagline isn't \"based on truth\", the tagline is \"based on a true *story*\".  Of which, the original story may or may not even be 100% factual on what actually happened.  People exaggerate and mislead in their recounting of events all the time.  So I would have to say that calling something \"based on a true story\" is a level removed in facts than saying \"based on truth\".  The story is just a sequence of events that happened at some point in time, not down to the detail what actually happened.\n\n&gt; And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.\n\nIs there an inherent problem with getting some facts wrong or leaving them out?  Since it's a movie do you expect people going to see these films are going there to be educated or are going to just be entertained?  If they're going to be entertained then why are you worried about the factualness of the story?\n\n&gt; Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch Pearl Harbour (2001).\n\nWhat if I don't want to watch a Sci-Fi action film?  What if I want to watch Saving Private Ryan -esque movies that aren't documentaries?  Things like Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and other war movies/shows tend to be based on something so why do I only have the choice between a History Channel special on WWII or nothing at all?  Because to be completely honest, I would imagine a 100% factual movie about WWII would have either a *lot* of people just sitting around waiting for stuff to happen or would just be a hogepodge of battle scenes that don't really make a story.\n\nI'm curious if you also hold the same standards for science.  Do you get really angry at space movies that fly things like planes and have fire or sound while people are floating around in the void?  I could go on about all the things those movies get wrong.  And I think that's a bit more grievous considering they actually *break physics*.  But in the end, it's entertainment.  If I wanted facts I'll go watch a documentary.",
    "rejected": "I sympathize with your frustrations, but I'm not sure I agree we need to start banning movies. A few points:\n\n\n\n&gt; It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.\n\nActually, it really should. In any capacity. We should not be in the business of encouraging people to swallow stories wholesale, whether they find them in the theater, on the internet, in a book, or in the paper. If you are endeavouring to discover the \"true story\", you should already be looking at multiple sources. This isn't even a difficult thing to do - you managed to do it with a quick wikipedia search.\n\n\n\n&gt;People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can).\n\nHow someone interprets the word \"based\" is not the responsibility of the filmmaker. All the simulacrum in the world does not change basic definitions.\n\n\n\n&gt; If you want to learn history, want a documentary.\n\nWhile it's true that documentaries are often held to a higher standard than historical films, this does not make them infallible. A lot of what passes under the genre of \"documentary\" is heavily biased, or even outright doctored. Films do you the courtesy of letting you know they are fabricated, whereas any fabrication in documentaries is presented as unvarnished truth. Should we ban documentaries too?  \n\n\n\n&gt;\"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson\".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nBecause people are interested in history, but they are also interested in the human condition, and how people relate to one another. Sometimes, they would prefer this to historical accuracy. Pearl Harbour's main purpose was to tell a story of love in a time of war - the focus was on human drama, and not historical accuracy. It's perfectly fine to criticize them about this, but why would you get outraged over Bruckheimer being honest about his intentions? He *should* be coming forward to clarify that history is his backdrop and not his subject. I'd be more infuriated if he was *not* up front about this. \n\n\n\n\nI'm not going to say that people can't be easily misled, because they certainly can. But what is the alternative? 100% accuracy in all things? In many historical cases we can't even form a working consensus on what happened, or for what reason - that doesn't eliminate the ancient drive to tell stories about our history. If filmmakers want to be as accurate as possible they can - the Band of Brothers series comes to mind. But if they would prefer not to, and are happy to tell us that they are not even trying, what's the problem?"

If you only listen to anecdotal accounts of whether prayer works, for example, then you'll get a very biased view, because nobody likes to talk about times when prayer didn't work.\n\nThere are ways to get around this, of course, but most of the time, if you're listening to anecdotal data, you're not trying to debias it, or weighing it properly; so it tends to have a disproportionate effect on your thinking."

    "prompt": "Pirating isn't immoral if you would not have bought the product anyway. CMV",
    "chosen": "Okay, here's my take, broken into a few sections:\n\n**Legality** I don't think this is what you're talking about, but I thought I'd mention it briefly anyway. When we're talking about legality, we might talk about what \"rights\" a person or entity has or doesn't have. We might also lump together people as single faceless business entities. I do think that it is \"good\" that we have laws that make piracy illegal in principle, even if these laws are difficult to enforce, and I don't always agree with how they're enforced when they are. But I think that the legality of piracy is pretty much a totally separate issue than what your CMV is about.\n\n**Financial Harm** - Most of the discussion here seems to be about the extent to which piracy causes any financial harm. If I create something and you pirate it, I'm not actually *losing* anything, so where's the harm. This actually isn't the main angle I'd use to approach the morality of piracy, but there is a point I think is important. You claim that you \"wouldn't\" have bought it anyway and have described the product as having some value relative to other priorities in your life (food, clothing, etc) and that there's a disconnect between this value and what the listed price of the software is. This justifies your belief that you wouldn't have bought it anyway, as it didn't have enough value. This is all fine, but I **don't** think you can honestly claim that your value assessment of the product is not affected by the possibility of pirating it for free. The mere fact that torrenting it is even an option that your considering reduces the value of the product, and thus unfairly raises the bar for what you're willing to pay for. So indirectly, I'd argue that the way piracy affects your value judgments and purchasing decisions *does* result in actual list sales for content right near the threshold of what you'd be willing to buy. You can *maybe* wiggle out of this if the buyer is **extremely** honest and self-aware, but in general, I'm really skeptical that anyone can really honestly be sure of what choices they'd make *if* piracy wasn't on the table. But I'll concede that if you have a really large bold **IF** qualifying your claim, maybe there's no financial impact.\n\n**Morality** - But like I said, that's not really the angle I'd use to argue that piracy is immoral. That's actually a lot simpler the way I see it. I'm a human being, and if I work hard and create something, I might **want** you to pay me something in exchange for reaping the benefits my hard work. Its not about \"rights\"; Those are for the lawyers. Its about you respecting my wishes as one human being to another. Simple as that. If I work hard at something and then you completely ignore how I request you to treat my work and use it without my permission, that's kind of a dick move. Period.\n\nAnd *if* the game of thrones producers or the folks at adobe *don't* mind you pirating their stuff, the moral concern dissipates. But that's not always the case, and when its not, you need to be honest about how you are or aren't respecting their wishes as human beings.",
    "rejected": "&gt;  if I would not have bought the product anyway  \n\nHow do you know this?  The fact you *can* pirate something already influences your decision and your claim regarding it.  \nIf there is an artist you like a lot, and you pirate the album and someone says something you can always claim, in self-delusion or outright lie: \"I wouldn't have bought it anyway\" and turn your piracy into something moral.  \n\nBeing broke is not a good argument, in the same way being poor is no argument for stealing, because being broke means you have to abstain from many material things, why are you not abstaining from these too?  If piracy were not an option, I am sure you would direct a nonzero amount of your savings to purchase what you are pirating, so this *is* effectively decreasing the industry revenue/profit.  \n\nI think your view is a circular argument even if we ignore the morality of it.  For you to back it up you'd have to be sure that every single item you have pirated ever was something you would not have bought had you had the money.  If the value of the pirated item is zero to you, then you paid zero and your argument kinda looks good again.  The fact you went through the hassle of obtaining it, probably having to circumvent protections, means the value of the content is not zero, yet you paid zero.  If after pirating it you dislike it and delete it to free up the disk space I would agree that what you did, while illegal, is not immoral for the reasons you pointed out."

There is nothing quite like picking out a melody on a grand piano and improvising around it.  No Ableton or Kontakt preset comes close to the sound of actual wood on actual string, reverberating round a large chamber, and VSTs just cant beat the nuances you can coax out of this odd contraption.\n\nYou are confusing production with performance.

Even if a computer can create it, the actual nature of the instrument means that the end result would differ because there are physical limitations and properties that create a wonderful variance.\n\nAlso people learn a lot about music, composition and so forth, by playing an instrument, so you can't really replace this by programming per-se, as the ins and outs of playing with other instruments and the knowledge gained there is a critical part for many producer and composers that it's essentially irreplaceable, I mean if you look at a group like Daft Punk, who are heavily oriented to complex electronic compositions, but they for the longest time was a band and did a lot of teeth cutting there. It may seem like electronic recording devices makes analogue applications of instruments obsolete, but they likely wouldn't be the composers or producers they are today without being the musicians they are."

Nationalism is the one that says \"America is the best, most perfect country in the world, unlike those other horrible, dirty, evil foreign countries. Americans are the shining example of civil people in the world and everyone else is filthy and brutish and doesn't deserve entry here\".

And these slogans don't even denote any sense of superiority over a foreign country, just a preference for your own country. if an advertisement was \"creating jobs for Americans and not for those dirty foreign leeches\", THAT would be claiming superiority over foreigners.

It's just that a US politician is responsible for things that occur within the United States but not responsible for things that occur elsewhere. It might be most efficient to create a bunch of jobs in Thailand, but that politician is supposed to be looking out for your interests not those of people in general or the Thai people.

    "chosen": "Based on available statistics, it's apparently easier to kill another person with a car than with a gun, but let's leave that aside for a moment. \n\nWhen you look at gun violence statistics, you need to go a little further than \"how many people were killed last year\". First, you need to ask \"who was killed, and why?\".\n\nOne reason this is important is that roughly 2/3rds of gun deaths are suicides. You might think this is a good reason not to have guns, but if so you'll need to explain why the U.S. suicide rate is in the middle of the pack compared to relatively culturally similar Western European countries (much less Japan, which has far more suicides with almost no guns). \n\nAnother reason this is important is that the vast majority of killings of other people are career criminals killing other career criminals (studies have shown that &gt;90% of both gun killers and their victims have prior felony records. \n\nNow, I don't think selling drugs on the corner is worth a death sentence, but I do question whether the real cause of these killings is guns, or if perhaps it's that criminals are violent people that get into violent situations with other violent people, particularly during a period of heavy prohibition (gun deaths were quite high during the original prohibition, even more so than during the War on Drugs). \n\nWhen you examine the boogieman of \"accidental\" killings with guns, this is pretty much a red herring. There are around [600/year](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_06.pdf) in the U.S. This compares to 3,700 accidental drownings, most of those in pools, which have even less use than guns. Or 30,000 poisonings, which, BTW, exceeds all accidental and intentional gun deaths. \n\nFinally, what other good can guns do? Self-defense is an oft-cited use, but accurate numbers are very hard to get. I'm going to use the most conservative estimate I can find, [based on national crime victimization surveys](http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable.pdf), which indicates that some 68,000 times a year someone prevents a crime using a gun. While not the 2.5 million a year claimed by the NRA, this is still a pretty significant amount of *reduced* violence that guns have caused, which you have to include in any balanced view on their increase in violence.",

    "prompt": "Religion created a fear of death, and it's time to get rid of both.",
    "chosen": "1) Pure presumption on your part.  You *believe* religion was created in this way for this reason, a believer would disagree.  This entire point rests on your presumption that *all* religion is false; or that it is at best a lie that serves a practical function.  You seem to discount any possibility that it might be true.  If you're unwilling to question that presumption, this CMV will be fruitless.\n\n&gt;Science and technology have not only disproved religion but have made it almost obsolete.\n\nHow do you suppose that religion has been disproven?  Various religious claims may have been found to lack support sufficient to prove them true, but I think you'll find that the difference between a believer and a non-believer often boils down to what a person believes is sufficient evidence to prove something.  Oddly enough, there is no evidence that indicates how much evidence we ought to need to believe something.\n\nEdit - This is in large part because many of the most important religious claims are [non-falsifiable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability).\n\n2) Time does not make the truth false.  Again, this rests on your unsupported presumptions of falsehood.\n\nBy what reasoning do you determine that these texts contain bigotry and by what system of values do you determine that bigotry is bad?\n\n3) This is a very simplistic generalization of religious beliefs; so much so that it's difficult to correct.  Once again, you're basing this on the presumption that it's all false.\n\n&gt;Religion teaches that when you die you have two options in the afterlife, eternal happiness in paradise, or eternal damnation.\n\nSome religious believers think that, others do not.  Even if you're not going to question your major presumption, you do need to recognize that treating religion as a homogeneous, singular entity is incorrect.  Beliefs vary widely and it's disingenuous to engage only with the other side's worst possible argument.\n\n&gt;This has caused people to worry over what will happen to them when they die and makes them act differently while alive as they only live to set their place in the afterlife.\n\nAnd this is necessarily a bad thing?  If this impulse kept them from hurting people or made them honest when they could have lied, wouldn't it be positive?\n\n&gt;Because of religion people have been taught to fear death.\n\nPeople begin fearing death as soon as they realize it can happen to them.  Religion didn't cause that.\n\nYou disregard any questions of existence after death as if you have some definitive evidence that it cannot happen.  In the absence of that evidence, this idea you have that the only rational response is to accept death and think no more is both irrational and arrogant.   You have no reason to make the claim, much less make it as confidently as you do.\n\n4) People are separated by disagreements of all kinds and getting rid of them without resolving them only works if you're going to disregard anything the other side says.  You may be content with your assumptions about the nature of death and you may not need solid reasoning to back the values underpinning your morals and ethics, but others disagree.  For you to assume that the disagreement should be resolved because you feel like it should be resolved is irrational.\n\nMake arguments and convince people that you're correct, don't just claim that the argument should be over because you want it to be so.\n\n5) I can't tell if this is a strawman or just an insult to the religious.  You're not just presuming that all religion is wrong, you're presuming that no religious person actually believes what they claim they do and that they are willfully deluding themselves.\n\nSo in other words: you feel that the falsehood of religion is a foregone conclusion despite the billions who disagree with you.  You believe this so thoroughly that you assume everyone else really knows it too, therefore everyone who says otherwise is either deluded, a liar or both.\n\nSo long as you keep this view, you're precluding any rational engagement with a person of faith.",

And most of the questions that religion addresses cannot be answered by the sciences. \n\n2) To some extent. They also teach principles that transcend time. \n\n3 &amp; 4) Religions primary purposes are to give comfort and explanation for things that our logic and observation cannot explain, to teach and reinforce a societies morals and ethics (something vital for survival as a group), and to provide of point of fellowship that fosters community and oneness within a region or group of people. Yes these thing can be points of contention between groups, but without some unifying feature such as religion we would fraction into more sub groups, not unify into one global whole. \n\n6) This is a blatant lie and insult. Many of our top scientists were religious. To quote Einstein: \"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\""

We shouldn't give up on nuclear energy, we should instead invest in something like this.\n\nOther forms of renewable energy are NOT cost-effective or efficient. Solar power plants get less and less effective the farther away you go from the equator, and transporting electricity is a problem, as more of it is lost with distance. Even with very high voltages, significant power loss over long distances is unavoidable. \nWind farms take a significant amount of resources to construct and maintenance is very expensive (they also have a tendency to kill birds, which can be problematic, especially near coastlines, which also happens to be where wind turbines are most cost-effective, due to strong winds and reasonable accessibility). Geothermal and Hydroelectricity depend on location a lot so they're not viable everywhere. Furthermore hydroelectricity has a tendency to ruin the environment too, for example read about Chinese hydroelectricity plants and the effects damming rivers have had on the river deltas there. Check their respective wikipedia pages for more details.\n\nA lot of things can be proven to not be necessary, strictly speaking (cars, internet, etc.) but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to get rid of them, and even if the US would get rid of them, it wouldn't convince anyone else.

Hydroelectric power is somewhat limited in its scope, and not available everywhere.  Solar and wind power can be somewhat seasonal, are not ideal everywhere, and solar energy obviously is not effective at night or in cloudy conditions.  Nuclear energy can help fill the gaps.  Also, solar and wind energy are not easily scaleable - if there's a surge, you can increase the power of a nuclear generator to compensate, we can't turn up the wind.  We could also compensate with batteries, but batteries typically have a pretty significant environmental footprint as well, and paying for huge amounts of energy generators and batteries together would be even steeper in terms of cost.  \n\nFourth, nuclear energy is ready... now!  That's a big deal.  We keep improving solar generators, and wind power is becoming more attractive, but nuclear energy is a very safe option with a proven track record (albeit a scary reputation) and has been around for decades.  \n\nFinally, regarding the international conundrum - the US still has a ton of nuclear weapons.  I feel like if they moved away from nuclear energy and still had enough nuclear firepower to blow up the moon... well it wouldn't provide too much additional leverage.  "

    "chosen": "&gt;365 has few factors, so a perfect division is not practical, but we can at least do better than what we have: months 1-5 have 31 days, and months 6-12 have 30, for example (month 6 would get Leap Day).\n\nThe year is not actually 365 days long. It's 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 48 seconds long. Your \"perfect\" redivision would have to account for this. This is why leap years exist currently. An astrophysicist developed a new calendar with a pattern of 30 - 30 - 31 that repeats and then accounts for the \"extra time\" with a leap *week* in December every five or six years. This calendar is called the Hanke-Henry permanent calendar. Every single year would be identical. Christmas would always fall on a Sunday, for example. Your birthday would always be on the same day of the week in perpetuity. The pattern of 30-30-31 is pretty much a requirement (or some alternating pattern, at any rate) due to the way the solar year works.\n\n&gt;The basic question I'm interested in is this: are there good reasons to have any of the inconsistencies that the Gregorian calendar currently has? \n\nThe developer of the Hanke-Henry calendar states that the main reason to avoid changing the calendar is a psychological one. Many people would be very sad that their birthday would never fall on a nice, lazy Saturday, for example. His calendar contains four Friday the 13ths every year. The main reason to make the change is purely financial. Even the developer of the Hanke-Henry calendar claims that the Gregorian calendar is extremely accurate, and the only thing he truly dislikes about it is day-drift, meaning that April 1st isn't always a Tuesday or what-have-you. You can read more [here](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-it-time-to-overhaul/).",

Why have the 2014-15 school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar?\n\nAnd so you would change *the calendar*? Not, say, the timetable for the school year? School years are only weird like that in some places. In many others, a single school year actually *does* line up with a calendar year. In Korea, for example, the year starts in March and ends in December. They didn't need to change the fundamental way everybody had gotten used to reckoning the passage of time, though, in order to achieve this end.\n\nThat brings me to my main point: everybody is used to the Gregorian calendar. A more sensible calendar might be, like, a little better, but how much? Most people don't spend a lot of time doing the kind of calendar arithmetic that would be alleviated by moving to a slightly more intuitive calendar - which, as you admit yourself, still wouldn't be perfect since a full year is 365.24998798765 days long, or whatever the number is. If a calendar must be imperfect due to the very nature of the thing it's measuring, why would we want to change to a new one? How many yearly man-hours of productivity would be saved by the change? How many years would it take for that benefit to offset the enormous confusion that would surely accompany changing something as basic and common as the Gregorian calendar? Switching from Imperial to Metric, for example, made sense because 1. every number is base 10 so calculations are stupidly simply, and 2. it just makes goddamn sense. It's a perfectly rational system. The productivity benefits have long since overbalanced whatever productivity might have been lost to the initial confusion. Your calendar switch satisfies neither of those criteria."

That is, intelligent design isn't necessary for life to exist.  But you state that your biggest issue is probabilistic.  However, when considering the likelihood of an event, you have to consider the time frame.  Over extremely long periods of time, events with vanishingly small probabilities of occurrence will almost surely happen.  We have a vague understanding of how life can form from inorganic material and we have a very long time horizon.  Combined that doesn't make life so unlikely.\n\nFrom a more philosophical point of view, inserting an intelligent designer into the mix just begs the question of how the designer was formed.  Was there nothing, and then out of nothing sprang a designer, and then the designer decided to create the universe, and then create life?  Has the designer simply always exists? It seems that every question you have about the creation of the universe that is answered by the existence of a designer can then be asked about the creation of the designer.  However, with an intelligent designer, unlike with the physical world, you don't have anything to actually study when you ask how the designer was created.  ",

But remember that the current state of the universe wasn't a goal by any means. Looking at the universe and saying \"it's so unlikely this happened\" is like rolling a trillion-sided-dice, looking at the result, and saying \"it's so unlikely this happened\". Yes, you're right, but you could say that about basically any roll. Similarly, yes, it is unlikely that carbon-based lifeforms were able to originate on earth and make it so far; but the universe is vast with many stars and many planets, and according to all scientific calculations, it's likely that other lifeforms exist somewhere as well.

In college, similar mechanisms are in place that, whilst they can't make you happy, can make sure that you're not totally adrift. That's why we have structured environments for young people, so we can build up our \"toolbox\" of coping mechanisms, so to say. College is your last stop before total independence, which is a very scary place.",
    "rejected": "I'd like to look at your assertion that you would be able to teach yourself or learn what you need to know for free. The problem is, the most valuable things you learn from college are going to be the things that you probably wouldn't be able to teach yourself. An example: when I was a tutor at college, I heard complaints about the liberal arts education all the time. It was usually from math, science, computer science, etc, students who were really good at one thing: their major subject. They resented the fact that they had to take one or two writing classes in order to get their degree. The problem? The STEM folks who complained about liberal arts education were all terrible at writing. So bad, in fact, that they wouldn't be able to function in the workplace because their writing was incomprehensible. I had several math and science professors complain to me that their students didn't understand that there are so many other skills they need to learn in order to be successful: writing, teamwork, problem solving, awareness of basic facts about history, politics, etc.  It seems to me that the broad liberal arts education is designed with the idea that every student should graduate with basic skills and understanding in multiple areas so that they will be more flexible and successful. So, you may not need to go to college to learn the basics of botany, but any *botanist* will tell you that, to succeed in that career, you need at least an undergraduate degree and probably a masters or doctorate. Also, having been both a student and an instructor, I can tell you that academics don't think students are mindless plebeians. They didn't get into this business to simply reward and punish students for jumping through hoops, but if a student is only thinking about a class in terms of reward and punishment, and shows no interest in learning the material because the material is important or interesting, they won't expend energy trying to change your view. If you go into a class thinking the thing that matters is getting an A, and you don't care about the material, then you are the one putting yourself in a box.\n\nTL;DR: A liberal arts education is trying to take you out of the box you are already putting yourself in. Just teaching yourself the things that are easy for you to learn and ignoring the hard stuff isn't going to help you in the long run. Also, you may consider yourself \"smart\" now, but if you don't challenge yourself by stepping out of your box, you won't be able to keep up with the people who do."

And if students had no time limit, God only knows that absurd tests professors would begin to give.\n\nA lot of professors, right now, have trouble managing the workloads that their tests include (and then they use the cureall of the grading curve to try and fix the 50 average with little spread they caused by putting 2 hours of work into a 1 hour test or the like).

A timed test is the perfect example of having an amount of work that needs to be done by a deadline.\n\n&gt;If it takes you an hour to solve a single question but takes someone else 5 minutes that shouldn't matter because it translates very poorly into an actual work setting, where deadlines are more often than not several days off.\n\nThere are so many things from schooling that don't translate well into the work setting.  This is one of the things that actually translates very well and directly.  It is common for deadlines to be days rather than hours, but that also includes a lot more work than a test.

    "chosen": "Understanding a dress code and dressing appropriately accomplishes several things:\n\n1) It signals an ability to follow and understand rules *even when they are unstated*. That is, by dressing appropriately, you show a respect for and willingness to join in the culture of the workplace. Not doing that shows you don't care or that you don't actually understand, both of which are bad signs to an employer. \n\n2) It signals a willingness to make an extra effort. Poor dressing is often lazy dressing. As between the guy that makes the time and effort to clear and properly wear a suit and the guy that comes in with jeans and a t-shirt, the person in the suit has shown a willingness to make an extra effort. All else being equal, the guy who makes the extra effort will naturally seem more appealing.\n\n3) Aesthetics are real, and they matter. Not all fashion is actually equal, just as not all people are actually equally physically beautiful. Knowing how to dress well encompasses many subtle aesthetic skills, such as color coordination, flattering use of lines, proper fit, and the look and feel of a piece of clothing. A person that knows how to put those things together clearly has an ability to recognize certain types of patterns. The better a person is at doing it, the better they tend to look. This helps in not just making yourself look attractive, it also signals that you have at least a certain degree of intelligence in the form of visual pattern recognition. If you think that is a joke, you should come to my school some time. Some of the sharpest dressers I've seen happen to be some of the smartest people I know. Anyone can dress up, but it takes a certain keenness of mind to dress *really well*. ",

He's confident, he looks like he gave the effort to match his professional attitude with a professional look, and he dresses like the kind of guy who should be telling other workers what to do.\n\nGuy #2 is a mess. He looks like he didn't even think about what someone will think about him, like he didn't even take time to look professional. If he was barking orders at someone, they would probably ignore him simply because he doesn't really \"look important.\" His look is immature, and I'd probably want him bringing my workers coffee, not telling them what to do.\n\nWhat you wear always conveys a message.

I'm found \"privilege\" in a social justice context to mean the same thing as \"ignorance\". A big part of intersectionality is accepting the fact that there are walks of life we can't understand; as a white man, I cannot understand some of the struggles a black person might face. Same for me and gays, women, whatever. When I am told to check my privilege, I understand that means I'm ignorant to an aspect of the minority experience, and I should make an effort to avoid this in the future.\n\nThere are aspects of being part of a group that's in power beyond just \"being in a majority\". Women, I believe, are actually a narrow majority in America right now, and they still have an appalling lack of institutional power, to say nothing of the numerous double standards and shaming tactics we use on them every day. By acknowledging that as a man I am in a privileged position, and perhaps acting to rectify that, I am doing my small part to challenge an existing status quo. By ignoring or denying my privilege, I allow this monopoly to continue.\n\nThat's the basis of privilege. It has nothing to do with shame; more often its used to counter shaming tactics.

You're supposed to think about it whenever you're tempted to judge others through the lens of your own personal experiences rather than trying to understand how the challenges they face may be different from yours. You're supposed to consider it when you think about the impact of public policy on those who are not like you.\n\nIf anyone is making you feel bad for how you were born, I'm sorry for that.

But that's not going to stop a Columbine (they had at least one), nor would a few teachers with handguns probably. So I don't see the point. \n\nBackground...I teach in a rough area. The school is safe, but many of the kids are likely to be targeted by gangs or have opportunities to join (many will but not the majority these days in the area). Some of my students are mentally ill but mainstreamed (bipolar, schizophrenic, etc). Some have violent tendencies. Heck, some teachers might. There are teachers with bpd that do good work still. \n\nReasoning\n\n1) My students see school ... Even with its flaws... as a place to escape major violence in many cases (not all violence, sadly). This proposition takes that away. I understand it's an ideal, but we all deserve to feel not just protected by might but free of it.\n\n2) school in America (and I've taught elsewhere) is too emotional. Teaching is emotional turmoil as is learning. Sure, police work is too but safety and defense is your primary focus there. It's not the kind of thing you want to tack on.\n\n3) defend against violent students or parents? Ha! I cannot even give people a piece of my mind, and I shouldn't. It's unprofessional to even THINK of such a thing and against our code of ethics. That idea rewrites basic ethics. Teachers would be sued. Period. It's impractical. \n\n4) cost. \n\n5) teachers are of better service in other ways during an emergency in most cases. (Law enforcement isn't slow to these scenes. Hiding, spreading word, getting locked down... All will save more lives against someone who likely has more than a handgun themselves.) \n\n7) kids grabbing the gun. I know there are special holsters etc but eventually, it's going to happen. Unlike the officer at my school, there is not a natural \"space\" given to me. I must build relationships. He must protect. He has the energy to watch his weapon at all times; no teacher has the extra focus energy for that, I'd imagine. \n\nThere are probably other logical reasons too, but my biggest reason is just that I'd consider such a place a hostile environment to be in.

So we have that, now lets say you have 3 accidents with the weapons due to teacher negligence.  What is the media going to report on, surely the prevented school shootings, but the 3 accidents are more then just week long stories.  Why is this? because trials.\n\nThe accidents will have trials, you can't just give teachers immunity for prosecution if the gun they are responsible for kills an innocent student due to their neglect, that would never be upheld by a court (sorry little johnny was killed because Mr. Suckswithguns thought it would be fun to play with what he thought was an unloaded gun while the students were testing, but because he's a teacher he can't be sued and you'll just have to carry the burden of knowing that Johnny's sacrafice made the world safer... seriously not going to fly for public opinion).\n\nIt would be so absolutely detrimental to the gun rights groups that it would probably end up shifting opinion.  News stories about settlements being handed out, and teachers going to jail for shooting their students (even though it was negligent), would make people go \"Wait you mean the people I trust with my kids suck with guns... I don't want my neighbor to have a gun, that dude is just an accountant, they are way less responsible then teachers\"...\n\nI'm not saying it wouldn't save more lives then it would end, I'm saying all you need is a few accidents (which will happen) and suddenly all you will hear about is the armed teachers who shot students on accident, and with the drop in school shootings, the only thing people will remember is the presence of guns in these schools is killing kids, not saving them, even though the exact opposite may be true.\n\nNinja Edit- Also don't discount the one teacher who might go crazy and kill a few kids on purpose before other teachers can get over to stop him.

Mind you, I'm not arguing that nerdiness and poor social skills don't tend to go hand in hand: I'm saying that you can be a nerd with excellent social skills. Such a thing is quite possible, and in fact fairly common. \n\nHere's the problem with nerd shaming: by equating nerdy pursuits with poor social skills, you discourage nerdy pursuits. For example, there's nothing unsociable about an interest in math, but if we equate nerdiness with poor social skills then being interested in math makes you, in society's eyes, unsociable. This discourages social people from pursuing nerdy interests, thus reinforcing the stereotype. It also isolates nerds from society, thereby worsening their social skills. This strengthens the stereotype, and leads to a negative downward spiral. \n\nTherefore, if we stopped shaming nerds, nerds would be less socially awkward, because they wouldn't be isolated, and sociable people would be free to explore their nerdy interests. \n\nBut perhaps more to your point, lets not consider the shaming of nerdy people, but the shaming of unsociable people in general. I'd argue that, contrary to your own personal experience, shaming unsociable people tends to decrease self improvement. Why? Well let's consider how people handle criticism.\n\nWhen a person receives criticism, even constructive criticism, it erodes their sense of self worth. Now a well adjusted person with a healthy sense of self worth can withstand that erosion, and use the criticism to be a strong sense of self worth through self improvement; this is more or less the process you described. However, let's consider what makes a person unsociable. It's from a lack of confidence which stems from a lack of self worth. Therefore, an unsociable person simply won't handle criticism as well as the average person; any given criticism amounts to a proportionally larger hit to their sense of self worth, thereby worsening their dilemma. On the other hand, a supportive environment where these people are accepted for who they are would allow them to build the confidence and self worth necessary to be a sociable person. ",

If someone knows that they can't live based on their pay from a fast-food joint then they'll have even more incentive to get an education and a better job.\n\nI live in the USA, so I'll focus my argument there.\n\nPeople who have minimum wage jobs aren't there because they're lazy. \nEducation is expensive. Obtaining skill and obtaining education, therefore, requires either help from someone who does have the money, or a way to earn the money by yourself. Normally, the parents of college-age people are expected to pay or to help, but with the crap economy, that can't happen the way it used to happen. \n\nSo you have a whole generation of people who are left to pay for college nearly entirely by themselves, in a time when wages are low and costs are high. Put simply, low-skill jobs pay so little that it's almost impossible to go to school full-time. Therefore, people are taking longer and longer to enter the workforce at a high level, and are spending more and more time in low-wage jobs. In the meantime, they're paying for part-time school, they're paying for housing, for food, for bills, for the costs of owning a car... and frankly, you cannot expect them not to have a social life until they're well-established in a job after four to to seven years of education--they wouldn't have a life until they're 40, which precludes a lot of family-starting. \n\nIn essence, the longer you wait to get an education, the more bills you'll end up accumulating, and that's unavoidable. In addition, the lower your wage, the longer you'll have to wait to get your education. Following that, the lower your wage, the longer you'll need to stay in a low-wage position. \n\nIt's a vicious cycle--low wages lead to lack of opportunity, which leads to low wages. Reducing or eliminating the minimum wage will only make that *worse,* not better.\n\nWhile yeah, there's probably a percentage of people who have the opportunity and are just too lazy, that doesn't describe most people who just *can't* get a better education. Giving them incentives to move upward won't work when they already have all the incentive they need, but no opportunity to do so.",
    "rejected": "I entirely disagree with the concept that you can do away with the minimum wage without having serious repercussions. \n\nI find that when we have money, we like to separate ourselves from each other. We are all people. This may sound stupid, but hear me out. The first thing I have a problem is that we have a sense of superiority toward those who work at lower-skilled jobs. Just because those people don't have the skills that someone else does, doesn't mean their job is worthless. A grocery bagger or cashier is just as important for society to thrive as a CEO of some company somewhere. I find it incredibly disgusting that people think that lower skill jobs are somehow worth less. These are still people, and they're people who make your life easier. Sure, maybe their job isn't as difficult or as demanding as yours, but they're just as entitled to a fair wage as anyone else is. If you disagree with that, then go build your own roads, grow your own food, and make your own society somewhere.  We as a society need to be able to work together and not have these huge class differences that we like to make. These people who work for these companies make that company operate. Where would McDonalds be without people to cook the burgers? I can't stand the idea that you can give those people, people without whom you wouldn't be able to make a damn cent, just the scraps or the bare minimum that they'll accept before they think it's not worth it. \n\nThe second thing is that how do you expect anyone to be able to move anywhere in life? Sure, society requires plumbers, electricians, and all--but how can you justify the idea that \"oh, they can just go get this barely livable job, oh well.\"? Life isn't just about survival, it's about living. If you don't want people to be able to live no matter what their job, go out and do their jobs for you yourself. \n\nThe minimum wage, in my opinion, is absolutely necessary. Companies go out of their way to cut wages and make sure that they're spending the least amount of money. It's about them trying to do whatever necessary to get as much money as possible, and they end up walking all over society to do so.  In my personal opinion, it may be a better option to force companies to actually care about their employees instead of just mandating a strict minimum. I feel like the rich are so clueless about what it's like to live at the bottom, that they don't realize that some people don't just have crap jobs, they're actually struggling to survive.  \n\nFurthermore, I don't understand the argument that \"oh, it's a bad thing to live on minimum wage.\" If you can live on minimum wage, and you are living, and providing your job service to society--why is that bad? Sure, we may not require thousands of engineers, but we definitely require people who can do things all over the spectrum. Whenever you step over those people, all you're doing is making life harder for everyone else. "

    "prompt": "The New Dr. Who is one of the most overrated shows of all time.",
    "chosen": "It's simply because people love the sense of adventure. When the TARDIS lands it could be anywhere in time and space. When compared to other science fiction shows I would say that is where it stands out the most. Shows like Star Trek are also about exploration and discovery which are an inherent part of adventure, but they occur within the confines of Starfleet. Doctor Who is about someone breaking out of the confinement of their society and going on a grand adventure by stealing what is essentially a magic box. The Doctor is also generally played by very charismatic actors and it is intriguing to wonder what it would be like to essentially be a god in that he is near immortal and Time Lords are essentially all knowing thanks to their research.\n\nIn terms of the special effects they have improved in the 11 era, but I've never cared much about them. Avatar may have the most impressive CGI of all time, but the movie bores me to tears. In terms of humor I don't know you, but the show has made me laugh particularly in 11's era which makes sense given Steven Moffat's sitcom background. (He created Coupling) The first season / 9th Doctor is a rough patch even for fans. There are some great eps in there, but also farting aliens the fans pretend don't exist. In many ways I think 11's first episode is a better starting point and not much is lost by starting there although it would be necessary to go back through 9 and 10 for the 50th special to make sense. The show has always had it's ups and downs and even seasons that are regarded as excellent such as season 3 have three of the best episodes of all time and 2 of the worst. It's the nature of a show with a loosely connected writing staff. \n\nIn terms of the fandom making it seem like a religion to you it just goes back to what I said about adventure. A story can occur anywhere in time and space so it tends to fuel the imagination of fans. Plus it is a 50 year old universe so there is a lot to go through if you get into it. The show is simply about going on adventures with an interesting character. No more, no less. Do I think it is one of the greatest shows ever? Absolutely. There is a reason it has lasted so long and inspired some of Britain's most successful talent which I think mostly goes back to my point about it fueling imagination. Do I think it outclasses something like Breaking Bad, The Wire, or The Sopranos? No, but each fulfills a need I have for my entertainment. ",
    "rejected": "Ok, now i understand that you think the show is underrated, and i and i don't necessarily disagree. But i don't think its weird that people have such an attachment to the show. If you have a show with enough episodes chances are people will like it. For example anime like Naruto and DBZ have loads of fans despite having incredibly slow paced story-line. In my opinion i think appeal, art style and good music is enough for people to stick around to love it. That is why for example people still think FF8 is a great game, it has good music and it takes a long time to complete it(if you draw magic). \n\nTime spent doing something means you get a detachment to it. Especially if several elements are in place to make you hooked. For example, in my 330 something episodes of Naruto i know the show is starting to suck, but i just cant give up on the show. I have grown to really like something i ought to hate. And people who are less self-conscious about the things they like, might express what most rational people hate. The fandom.\n\nHaving many episodes is also important to creating a cult. If you got a cult, everyone who wants to feel super special or \"nerdy\" will hold onto it for their life. And its hard to avoid it. For example the amount of references you can pull surpasses Monthy Python and Star Wars combined. \n\nAlso, my theory to why its so popular is that we are waiting for the next great thing to latch onto(outside of anime) in nerd culture. Harry Potter is finished, the Lotr hype has cooled off before the Hobbit arrived, Star Wars is only recently starting to sound like its on its way. Same with Game of Thrones except that its a new thing that has swept us. And the cult following will plague us for ages. Especially Dr. Who since we refuse to let it die. \n\nBut you must understand that the nature of the show makes it very easy for people to gain an irrational love for it. \n\nNow Doctor Who has an appeal, enough episodes. And the episodes are made in such a way that the story can go where it wants to. The time machine has made it easy to make creative content and make it fit. So it can tell many stories, some of them bad and some of them very good. But it will be many stories, meaning that with many many different stories. The chances of finding something you like increases and might make you fight through the series until you let it grow on you. Remember even if you think the show isn't that good. A bad clock still shows the correct time twice a day. \n\nAnd that is why Doctor Who is so popular IMO. "

    "prompt": "I don't think women earn less than men.",
    "chosen": "I think that you are confusing two separate sets of data. The studies that show that women earn \"77 cents to every man's dollar\" are talking about lifetime gross earnings. Basically, this is saying that a woman will, on average, make about 3/4 of what a man makes over the course of her entire lifetime. It's taking into consideration things like job growth potential, raises, promotions, etc. \n\nWhat these studies *don't* say is that if a man and a woman are both working next to each other in an office, the man gets a higher paycheck for the same job. That type of blatant micro-level sexism is not what the data shows. I'm sure that there are some employers that would pay a woman less, but there are also legal protections in place to attempt to correct this. \n\nThis data really points to a larger macro-level, structural imbalance--women being passed up for promotions, executive positions, etc. \n\nSo, in a way, you are correct. Men and women doing the same job for the same company probably do make very similar wages. The issue, however, becomes apparent over long stretches of time and large sample sizes.\n\nEdit: Very sorry if my original wording was confusing or inadequate. When I was referring to the \"data\" I was not simply referring to the 2011 study on the 2010 Census--the source of the \"77 cents\" statistic. What I meant to do was identify a trend in the past 50+ years of academic theory and research. Basically, according to the US Department of Labor:\n\n&gt; According to one analysis by the Department of Labor’s Chief Economist, a typical 25-year-old woman working full time would have already earned $5,000 less over the course of her working career than a typical 25-year old man. If that earnings gap is not corrected, by age 65, she will have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars over her working lifetime. We also know that women earn less than men in every state and region of the country, and that once you factor in race, the pay gap for women of color is even larger.\n\nFor further sources, please see:\n\nhttp://www.ijull.co.uk/vol7/2/thomson.pdf\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/31/cmi-equal-pay-report\n\nhttp://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf\n\nhttp://social.dol.gov/blog/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/\n\nI very much understand that there are flaws with the \"77 cents\" figure (as with any point of data). I still firmly hold, however, that whether we want to say that the wage gap is 77%, 90% or even 99.9%, that is an issue that needs to be systemically corrected. ",
    "rejected": "&gt;I've seen a million studies that show women make less. I've seen a million studies that show men make less. And I've seen a million studies that show everyone makes about the same.\n\nThis is actually a fallacy. There are ZERO studies that show everyone makes the same. All studies show that women earn less. There are however many very convincing \"opinion columns\" and articles written by conservatives that  blame the wage gap on \"women's choices\" such as preferring to work fewer hours or different careers. While those reasons are a part of the wage gap, they are just a part, and in reality, a large portion of the differences in hours worked and job position is caused by employer discrimination in hiring and promotions. Not to mention, saying \"Women earn less because they make different choices\" does not mean women don't earn less, it means they do. They just have other pressures that interfere with them earning what men do.\n\n&gt;I think every study that shows that one gender makes more than the other is incomplete or fallacious, and I strongly believe that most studies are done by people who are looking for a particular outcome to prove what they already hope to be true.\n\nThat's how \"reports\" and opinion columns work. Not science. Scientific studies prove that women earn 77% of what men do on average, and that EVEN when accounting for the differences like job position and hours worked, the average woman earns 7% less than a man with an identical position, hours, education, and experience.\n\n&gt;When considering all aspects of employment (wages, hours worked, benefits, experience, occupation, and anything else that could be a factor) I seriously believe that men and women probably make a very similar number; a number so similar that there are no grounds for advocating either gender needs more pay. I am equally willing to believe that men make less money as I am to believe women make less money.\n\nNo, for identical job positions, hours worked, experience, and occupation. Women earn about 7% less. On top of that, consider that things like differences in job position are a mechanism by which discrimination causes women to be paid less. I.E. Many companies prefer to hire men for high paying positions instead of women, or prefer to give raises and promotions to men, causing women to be paid less in a way that appears to be explained by \"differences in job position\"\n\n"

    "chosen": "&gt;But Businessmen...They study how money functions in a populated system. However helpful and useful that is in facilitating the exchanges between people in a system, it can't ever advance society.\n\nYou're right. Business people don't study anything that will help society advance in these ways. But that's not really what a business degree is for.\n\nA business degree has much more in common with a trade school than a degree in physics or medicine. A business degree isn't really even an academic subject as much as learning a white collar trade.\n\nThe actual *study* of business won't help society. It won't really help anyone other than the student, assuming that the degree will help them land a job. However, what they do with that degree could help society immensely, and we, as a society, would be totally fucked without them.\n\nLet's take a scientist for example. The scientist would be useless if he didn't have his lab. His lab would be useless if it didn't have power, equipment, lab assistants, running water, and supplies. Labs, in short, are very, *very* fucking expensive. So for the scientist to do his work, he needs bookkeepers to pay the bills, he needs the finance guys to secure capital, he needs the business analysts to keep processes efficient and cost effective, he needs the CFO to map out a sound financial strategy, he needs HR to screen applicants, he needs operations to keep the building in good shape, he needs marketing to generate revenue to pay for the next project, and on and on and on and on.\n\nAll of the useful things that doctors, scientist, and engineers accomplish depend on competent businessmen and women to keep all of the peripheral stuff up and running. Without all of those business students, all of the useful professions wouldn't be able to do much of anything, and they would waste huge amounts of time sorting through bills and trying to budget (things that they're probably not particularly good at) instead of playing to their strengths.\n\nTo create these competent business people that will help us achieve new and amazing things in science, engineering, and pretty much every other field, we need people to learn the business trades. So in that sense, the study of business is hugely helpful to our society, because without them we wouldn't even be able to keep the lights on.\n\n**TL;DR** Scientist can't science if we don't keep their institutions up and running, and the study of business is, essentially, the study of keeping institutions up and running.

    "prompt": "I think that much of social construct theory is baseless, as social constructs must ultimately originate from genetic predispositions.",
    "chosen": "You're making a category error. The notion of a social construct addresses ideas, whereas I'm pretty sure in comparing it to biology you are thinking of it in terms of behaviors? They're not really the same thing.\n\nFor example when people talk about \"The South\" they tend to forget about how there are like, a lot of african americans. The South is thought about as an [exclusively white place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUFL2GT1-2g), [which doesn't reflect the reality of the situation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama#Race_and_ancestry). But it affects the way people behave toward it and think about it, and that's called a social construct. So even if biology conditions behavior to some extent we can still recognize the way ideas are created and question our assumptions and change the way we behave toward those ideas. You're pretty much granting that at least that much free will is possible by posting in change my view so I'm taking it as a given.\n\nThere's not really any one \"Social construct theory\" so let's talk about something more specific, like [Edward Said's Orientalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)). The gist of it is that other cultures are often oversimplified when represented in the west, and especially as static through time and unsophisticated, with the implicit point that western culture is dynamic and vital. This sort of representation happens even in art, where oriental themes are presented as aesthetically superior but fail to fully engage with the complexity and history of the culture.\n\nSo like, as for contemporary examples maybe think of western otaku--or I guess I got the sense they all died out in 2008 but you know what I mean--who think of Japan in terms of the oversimplified picture they get from manga and anime. Or to address the common stereotype that Japan is a country tolerant of bizarre sexual fetishes; remember the panty vending machine thing? [As it turns out that was a workaround to a law that *banned* pornographic vending machines, which itself wasn't so odd given the popularity of vending machines in Japan](http://www.snopes.com/risque/kinky/panties.asp). And yeah, the panty vending machines were banned too. As it turns out the Japanese aren't like, homogeneously creepy. \n\nThis isn't to say cultural differences aren't real; that would be silly. Only that the way culture is represented--even well meaningly!--is reductive in a way that often smothers critical thought and inflates the egos of the people that made the representation.\n\nAnyway, all of that is just to say that the idea of a social construct isn't bullshit when you know what people mean by the phrase. As for its applicability, let's look at what I'm pretty sure you really mean, or one thing I'm pretty sure you really mean: biologically essential sex differences. Now whether or not those exist at all and to what extent is too big a topic to get into here. But there are enough bad ideas from history that are obviously silly and follow the patterns of a social construct as detailed above that the idea of social constructs explaining many perceived sex differences holds together pretty well. And that should encourage us to be pretty suspicious of our own ideas about gender and sex. After all, everyone else who came before us thought they had gotten it right too.\n\nAnyhow, here's a short-ish list of some of the most relevant ones: \n\n*[Sexual division of labor is intrinsic, and women belong in the home when it has been pointed out time and again that this is mostly a product of the industrial revolution.](http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Division_of_labor.aspx)\n\n*[That women are more likely to make pacts with Satan because they have a voracious sexual appetite.]\n(http://witcombe.sbc.edu/davincicode/witches.html)\n\n*[That women want sex less than men (but wait didn't they just say the opposite? And wait, don't we still believe that?)](http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/turns-out-women-have-really-really-strong-sex-drives-can-men-handle-it/276598/)\n\n*[That women have big asses because god made them for sitting.](http://people.uncw.edu/smithrw/200/WomenQuotes.htm)\n\n*[Basically everything this asshole had to say about it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle's_views_on_women)\n\nYou get the point. Now a lot of people would probably object that these are verifiably false and we know better now--but really we're agreeing here. These conclusions came from reasoning that was *considered* just as valid as science, and so we can't take our assumptions at face value. Which is doubly true when you consider how the scientific method has been blind to prejudice, cf [phrenology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology) and [this overview here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politicization_of_science).\n\nAgain, none of that is to say there are *no* sex differences; that's an unsettled question. But biases arise in ways you wouldn't expect, and common claims should be examined critically.\n\nAnd as for the nature vs. nurture debate, if you think it's any closer to being settled than it was in the 18th century I think you should read up on the emerging field of [Epigenetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic)--as it turns out Lamarck wasn't 100% wrong!--and the [Flynn Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect).\n\nHope that helped!",
    "rejected": "&gt;My reasoning for this is that social influence could not always have been in play; hundreds of thousands of years ago there was no such thing as language and thus \"social constructs\" could not exist.\n\nNot all communication is verbal. Animals that do not possess language have social constructs that are [subject to change](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020106). While these social constructs certainly have natural factors, I do not believe you can assume language creates social constructs. \n\n&gt;I believe the scientific consensus is that genetics (nature) tend to have more bearing on individual behavior than social context or upbringing (nurture). If this is true, a given \"social construct\" could only attain widespread prevalence if it appealed to something inherent in the physical makeup of a large group of humans.\n\nFor the sake of argument, I will accept the first statement as factual, and attempt to demonstrate how it does not prove the second the statement. If cultural constructs were largely pre-determined by genetics, it does not explain both the diversity of cultures, or how cultures mix and influence each other. \n\nLooking at isolated cultures, we see some radically different social norms: e.g. what is beautiful or obscene, polyandry and polygamy rather than monogamous relationships, matriarchies or egalitarian societies, concepts of ownership and value, and religious beliefs. As these cultures often change upon extended exposure to other cultures, we cannot assume that these people are *genetically* predisposed to different social constructs, rather that their social constructs were created parallel to we believe to be the norm. \n\nEurope has many countries that have very distinct cultures despite a great deal of cultural interactions, similar genetics, and similar resources and climates. If culture were largely genetically predetermined, these cultures would be far more homogenous. \n\nAdditionally, looking at first generation immigrants versus their parents demonstrates a large difference in how similar genetics can operate very differently in different social constructs. If behavior and values are largely genetically predetermined, then we would see the children of those raised in a different culture holding onto the same social constructs as their parents, while they are far more likely to assimilate and reflect the values of the culture they were raised in.\n\nAs social creatures, part of the human psyche is to express belonging through different social constructs, whether that behavior is oppositional or participatory. While this is a natural urge, it produces cultural constructs that are meant to differentiate rather perfectly reflect natural factors. The origin of social constructs can be said to lie in biology, but their expression requires diversity rather than perfect alignment with hard-wired genetics. \n"

Logical deductions based on observational facts.  Now, you could argue that the divergence between the two is that science is falsifiable while philosophy is not and you'd have a bit of a point, but consider mathematics, economics, and high level physics.  We have no experimental way of proving a lot of the \"theoretical science\" out there just as we have no way of proving philosophical arguments besides our intuitive logic.  It gets even more complicated proving anything when you add in the statistics of experimental design and deal with multiple comparisons and arbitrarily picked hypothesis testing.  This is especially true in the biological and medical fields because of the pressure of publications.  \n\n\nOn a more personal note, I think philosophy should actually be taught in grade school all the way up through high school.  Why?  Because it teaches people to think critically and to love thinking for themselves.  You learn the logic of the western world and start to see that there isn't a clear right or wrong, but many shades of gray.  Philosophy has had a large impact on my life to this point and bubbles up into my life studying science all the time.  It's taught me how to argue, understand arguments, and write more concisely (something desperately needed in the sciences...).

Most of the people I know who we're studying the sciences we're required to take at least one philosophy class about ethics. Because while experimentation and observation are excellent ways of deducing the nature of reality (much better than just thinking about it, in my opinion) they are not very good at determining what is *ethical* or not. Is it ethical to clone humans? Ethical to augment human brains? Ethical to test makeup on animals? These are all philosophical questions.\n\nThere is also logic and deductive systems. On CMV (and elsewhere) on reddit you'll see loads of people talking about \"valid arguments\" and \"fallacies\" and all kinds of argumentative jargon that comes straight from the field of philosophy.

What will you do?  Can you pursue the same career or find a new one?  Will you make enough money to live comfortably?  Wages in the US are still higher than most of the world, and Americans still enjoy a higher standard of living.  For example, I work full time as an English teacher in a big universtiy.  I make about 15,000 a year, and my salary is significantly higher than average for a native English teacher in my area.  While some things are cheaper, like rent, other things, like clothes, electronics, and food, are more expensive.  Overall, the standard of living is significantly lower, and most people live month to month, paycheck to paycheck.\n\nAside from finances, changing to a new country involves a lot of personal sacrifice.  Leaving friends and family behind is tough, and forging new friendships and relationships can be challenging, especially if there's a language barrier.  Culture shock is real, and you'll learn to appreciate some things about American culture that you had taken for granted before.  Overall this can be a positive experience.\n\nAfter I've reflected on my comments, depending on where you are in your career, I would recommend that you *do* leave the country for a short time.  Maybe do a stint in Asia or Latin America teaching English for a year.  It'll give you new insights into what is really good and bad about America.  It's valuable work and life experience, **BUT** don't burn any bridges back to the US.

    "chosen": "I'm going to take a different approach from the other posters by discussing what a \"socialist\" president would do and how it affects the argument.\n\nFirstly, what does Bernie Sanders want?:\n\n1. Universal Healthcare.\n2. Universal Basic Income.\n3. Free College Tuition.\n4. A reigned in spying system.\n5. An end to unnecessary military interventions.\n6. An end to wall street profiteering.\n7. Pro Renewable Energy and Anti Fossil Subsidies/Global Warming\n\nThat's basically what he is pushing for (as far as I know; Not sure what his position is on immigration).\n\nNow you have to ask yourself how much these things cost.\n\n1. Medicaid and Medicare cost a combined $773 Billion (2013, so before most of the ACA benefits kicked in). Couldn't find a solid number, but some of the private provider numbers imply private insurers made about $650 billion in revenues in 2010 which becomes about 700 billion if adjusted to 2013. Giving the cost of providing care to all the people in the system as of 2013 at about $1.47 trillion a year. If you factor in the uninsured (about 15% of the population). The same costs would be $1.73 trillion\n\n2. The 2010 census says there are 243,275,505 adults and 74,181,467 minors. If every adult was given $12,000 a year and every child $4,000, the program would cost $2.919 Trillion for adults, and $298 billion for the children.\n\n3. The amount of tuition charged in 2012 was $69 billion. If the number tripled every year for 12 years due to increased demand AND also increased 5% a year it would amount to $3.12 trillion or about $260 billion a year.\n\n4. A few different sources say it is about 80 billion a year to run US Intelligence in general.\n\n5. Iraq and Afghanistan cost the US anywhere between $4 and 6 Trillion depending on who you ask.\n\n6. [This NYT article puts the cost of the 2008 recession at 4-25 trillion dollars.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/business/economy/the-cost-of-the-financial-crisis-is-still-being-tallied.html?_r=0) So let's split the difference and call it $14.5 trillion.\n\n7. Fossil Fuel Subsidies cost $38 Billion Annually, Climate Change will cost 1.9 Trillion dollars by 2100, this amounts to about 24 Billion a year on average (these numbers are just for the Atlantic and Gulf States and don't take into account drought damage as I could not find a solid source for that(the likelier number is probably 3x that much).\n\n\nSo let's figure these numbers in to what we are currently dealing with.\n\n1. Using United Healthcare as a basis, 4.6% of revenue is profit for private insurers. Most patented drugs are hundreds of times more expensive than they cost to make and hospitals jump at any opportunity to overcharge patients. [If this article is any indication, negotiating down the price of patented drugs could save as much as $200 Billion a year](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-best-selling-blockbuster-drugs-2012-6?op=1). If you take all these numbers and don't account for a number of other things that would further reduce costs (CEO pay, removing the middlemen, across the board forced negotiations), UH would cost about $1.48 Trillion and cover everyone.\n\n2. All the various current forms of welfare amount to about $220 billion, removing redundancy lowers the actual bill to almost exactly 3 Trillion a year for this.\n\n3. Removing existing government supported educational grants lowers the actual cost of this to $220 billion.\n\n4. Even a 15% funding cut lowers the cost of intelligence to about $68 billion.\n\n5. At 4 trillion since 2001 (the most conservative measures), just not being in afghanistan or iraq amounts to 286 billion a year.\n\n6. This is 2.42 Trillion a year, between 2008 and 2015. if you assume these downturns happen every 20 years, then the actual cost is $725 billion a year (naturally adjusted to inflation).\n\n7. This amounts to about 60 billion a year.\n\nAlright, now there's all sorts of other factors. \n\nOne of the most damaging factors to our economic growth is that employers in this country are saddled with the costs of providing their employees healthcare. As previously shown, this is both expensive and inefficient due to everybody in the chain wanting to profit. Universal healthcare would embolden EVERY employer in the US. [8% of civilian and private employee benefits and 11.6% of state and federal employee benefits are health/insurance benefits.](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecec.nr0.htm) If this windfall directly translated to jobs, the result would be 12.3 Million new jobs. If it only translated to a proportional 20% gain in new jobs, it would still result in 2.46 million new jobs.\n\nAnother factor: UBI money doesn't poof out of the economy the same way CEO pay does, the poor and middle class people would spend the majority of this new money. If 85% is put directly back into the economy (a reasonable number), it would result in 2.55 Trillion in new consumer spending. If you assume corporations will hire a new employee for every 1.5 million that they make, the result would be 1.7 million new jobs. Not to mention sales taxes boosting state revenues.\n\nFree tuition would result in a couple 10k new high paying jobs (university staff) and a temporary boost of several 10k more construction employees for construction.\n\nSo what does a Bernie Sanders Presidency (where he gets everything he wants) get you?\n\nFree Healthcare and Education for everyone. Enough Income to get most of your basic affairs in order. A much more stable world and economy. 5 million new jobs. If you cut 200B from the defense budget the result is a 5.5 Trillion yearly expense budget, in comparison to the current one which if you figure in the various wars and wall street instability is about 4.6 Trillion.\n\n\nFactor in the dependant tax credit redundancy (-60 billion) and the fact that none of the 12 million illegal immigrants would receive these benefits (-112 billion), the final cost is an added 780 billion expenditure a year.\n\nAll of the new jobs and the resulting total increase in income tax revenues might well cover most if not all of the difference.\n\nPS: If we perfectly matched Canada's Per Capita health expenditure, it would cost us 951 billion to cover everyone's healthcare. **This would lower the final added expenditure to only 251 billion.**\n\n**TL;DR:** If you do everything Bernie Sanders wants, the result is an extra 251 billion in expenditures a year. If you don't include UBI (which is currently the most expensive thing and the hardest sell), you get a 2.6 Trillion *drop* in expenditures.\n\n**Edit:** [His Proposition of a Robin Hood Tax. This would cover those extra 251 billion, dropping the final expenditure to -49 billion against the previous year.](http://www.robinhoodtax.org/news/blog/sen-bernie-sanders-officially-introduces-robin-hood-tax-act)",
    "rejected": "What spending do you feel is unnecessary? \n\nHere is a pie chart of all discresionary spending (2009 data):\n\nhttp://dissidentvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/3-Discretionary-Budget-2009.jpg\n\nHere is all spending (2012):\n\nhttp://climbingthefinancialmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Federal-Spending-2012.png\n\nSo where are you cutting? \n\nWelfare and entitlement is a popular place. However, keep in mind that for every welfare dollar spent, the government collects somewhere over $0.60 in tax revenue. People who get welfare spend the money immediately in the economy, and that generates a lot of economic activity. So it's very difficult to actually close a budget by cutting safety-net programs.\n\nNext up is Social Security and Medicare. These programs are funded through FICA taxes. They would both be fine if for some reason we didn't exempt all income over $118,500 from FICA taxes. Even with no changes, Social Security could continue to pay out 75% of current benefits forever. Meanwhile, CMS and medicare does all the actual hard work in health care. They establish the billing codes, decides what is reimbursed at what rate, etc. All the private insurers basically say \"we pay what medicare pays\" for everything. They do this while running a 3% overhead. For the purpose of comparison, private health insurers run 20-25% overhead. Any shift of healthcare from CMS to the private industry would me a massive loss of efficiency. Again, you can but things, but that doesn't mean you actually help yourself out in the long run.\n\nYou can rail against the US Dept of Education or the EPA, but the reality is that completely eliminating these programs are 1. not going to close the budget deficit, and 2. incur substantial societal costs.\n\nConservatives seem to see taxation and spending as inherently bad the for economy. This is simply not accurate. Money gathered by the government is injected right back into the economy. Money \"wasted\" on bureaucrats is money that is paid, as a salary, to consumers who then go out and use it to buy goods and services. This is why European countries are able to sustain tax rates that are significantly higher than the US and still have strong economic growth. Taxes are not bad as long as long as they are spent back into the economy. Here is a graph of GPD per capita:\n\nhttp://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/real-gdp-per-capita.png\n\nAs you can see, there is not a huge difference in economic growth rate between the US and Europe, despite the differences in taxation and spending policies.\n\nIn regards to the defecit, debt for governments is different than consumer debt. The first major difference is the interest rate. The US government is currently paying 2.13% interest on 10 year loans. That's basically equal to expected inflation over that period; in other words the US is borrowing money for free right now. Because it is seen as a 100% safe place to stash money, people are willing to give it to us to hold onto for a while. It is also denominated in US dollars. Conveniently, the US government is responsible for printing US dollars. It could literally print the money to pay off it's debts at any time. Printing money causes inflation, so the US government doesn't do this, but it could. The only way we could possibly default on our debt is through deliberate political action on the part of our government. It's like Debt is a room full of shit, except you make the shit, and you decide how much gets shoveled out every day. You have to control the level of the debt, but as long as you keep it stable over the long run it's not a terrible thing. In fact, when Clinton was president there was a lot of concern that the US government was going to pay off it's debts and there would be no more T-Bills. This caused a lot of anxiety among investors as they depend on treasuries to balance their risk."

    "prompt": "Having a child is more selfish than not having one",
    "chosen": "Well, from one perspective both choices are equally selfish, because they are just different answers to the question of \"What do **I** want from life?\" In both cases people have or don't have kids because that's *what they want*, not because of broader societal consideration. Hence: selfish.\n\nI'm sure there are some people who do want kids but choose not to for ecological reasons. But they're very much in the minority: most of the people who talk about how \"selfless\" it is not to have kids are the people who actively don't want kids anyway (and are thus \"making a virtue out of necessity\"). And most people who talk about how \"selfless\" parenthood is actually had kids *because they wanted kids*. Very few people don't want children but still *choose* to have them (accidents, of course, are a separate issue).\n\nAnd it's also pretty easy to argue that, from a societal standponint, parenting is the less selfish option. There's a pretty persuasive paper about children being [public goods](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2117807?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104912264287) - that link is to the official \"TL;DR,\" as it were. That's like a negative externality in reverse - parents shoulder a disproportionate cost of raising kids (the tax credits are a joke compared to the actual costs involved - and that's just the monetary costs; we're not even talking about time and other less tangible resources), while society reaps the benefit of a replacement generation.\n\nNow - in a society with low infant/maternal mortality rates, it's good that so many people are opting to have no kids (or, like our family, opting to have just the one). But again, this is making virtue out of necessity: when presented with reliable contraceptives many people *choose* not to have kids, or to have fewer kids.\n\nBut with both parents and non-parents, the societal benefits are typically a side-effect, and not a major factor in the decision-making process. The choice is still made for selfish reasons.\n\nSo it's fine if you don't want kids - really, as long as you're not nasty to my kid for no reason, I couldn't care less what you do with your life. But when you're old, you will reap the benefits of having younger people to change your diaper and dispense your medication, diagnose and treat your numerous ailments, grow and transport your food, stock your supermarkets, keep your power on and put your fires out. If you don't think that today's kids (who are tomorrow's adults) will be of benefit to you, go read (or watch) *Children of Men* - it's not great literature or cinematography, but it sure is thought-provoking. \n\nIt is therefore unreasonable to claim that parents are more selfish than the childfree. The motivations of both are equally selfish, and from a human-well-being perspective the outcomes skew somewhat in favor of the parents.",
    "rejected": " \n&gt; When you become a parent, your brain chemistry changes and you biochemically become a completely different person. You've crossed the void and there's no going back, your life is your child's and no longer your own.\n&gt; \n\nThis is a huge exaggeration. Sure, there are plenty of chemical responses when you have a kid, but not any more than when you ride a roller coaster or go on a first date.  You may be referring to mothers who finally have something exciting and worthwhile to do with their time and go overboard with facebook posts. This is not typical, usually parents just drag the kids around to do whatever they were going to do if they never had kids. (some age-restrictive activities ARE phased out, but this often coincides with maturing anyway)\n\n&gt; This is why parents can deal with baby's crying and pooping and general nastiness, because you are evolutionarily primed to love your child that much. Having a child is objectively a bad decision, economically, time-wise, etc. However, the emotions that come with parenthood are indescribable for those without kids, it truly is a drug. \n&gt; \n\nLike I said before, it's not that big of change, and nothing you couldn't experience without kids. There are plenty of nurses who clean up after others, and EMT's deal with even more.\n\n&gt; Not having child is objectively a great decision, economically, time-wise, etc. However, you miss out on what a significant part of the human experience. Moreover, it is much easier to fall into a life that feels purposeless without a child as an easy answer.\n&gt; \n\nFrom a selfish point of view, this is true.\n\n&gt; When I weigh the two together, I can't help but come to the conclusion that having a child, getting high off of parenthood, and creating conscious and needy life is more selfish than using the resources you would use on the child to better the world. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am making the assumption that instead of child-bearing the would-be parent involves him or herself in some sort of meaningful charity work. I also want to be clear that I'm not saying that having a child makes you a selfish person, or even that having a child is necessarily selfish in and of itself. My view states only that it is more selfish than abstaining from parenthood.\n&gt; \n\nRaising a child is the most economical use of resources you can possibly have. Generally speaking, you are creating a better version of yourself, not to mention you still contribute a little bit to society while raising a kid, but everything that kid does in the future is because of your efforts. As far as efficiency goes, Having kids is like having compound interest on everything you do, and it keeps adding up until the human race is extinct. \n\nHaving a kid is not an easy way to \"get a high\", it IS however, extremely rewarding for the amount of effort put in. Having a child will also often drive a person to better themselves, and work harder at improving their community.  \n\nMy own experience and reasoning for having children is that life was too easy (white male in north America), and while I can do much to help better the world around me, the best thing I can do for society is to make the next generation stronger by instilling it with my own values. Having kids is the best way to achieve this.\n\n\"A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in.\"\n\n&gt; Full disclosure, I am childless, extremely young, and completely unqualified to have a legitimate opinion on this topic. I'm not sure if I want children or not, but I don't want it to be a flippant decision. Interested to hear from some parents and others with more experience.\n\nI'm glad to see you putting so much thought into this issue. Please remember though, that all of my stated benefits to having children can be gained by helping to raise any children. http://www.bigbrothersbigsisters.ca/en/home/default.aspx\n"

It's easy to consider human consciousness as significant when it's what we're exposed to our entire lives, but in the grand scheme of the universe, we are merely a speck. Likewise, going small-scale on that interactive page also demonstrates how possible it is for small parts of matter and energy to create something as unique and cool as a human consciousness.

Our conscious mind, our experiences, isn't just a random artifact; it's a basic function of how our brains work.  A person without that would behave very differently.   For example, it's thought that one of the functions of having a conscious mind is the ability to picture in advance how other people see you, and how they will see you if you do certain things (\"how will people respond if I say X?\").   In order to do that, we have created a mental symbol of ourselves in our own minds that we can look at from outside and manipulate in order to make predictions, which is a part of what consciousness is.    If a person had some kind of problem with their brain where they were unable to do that, where they were unable to be conscious of themselves, they would not be able to function in society.\n\nConsciousness, IMO, is basically our forebrain's operating system, or at least a key part of it; a person without it would not be able to function the same way most people do.\n\nEdit: I think that a key part of the reason that this feels so weird is that, compared to computers, are brains aren't very good at communicating with each other.   We can create all kinds of very complicated thoughts, but then to communicate them to someone else we have to resort to very low-information density mediums, like text or speech.  It's like a supercomputer with a 2400 bps modem; there's a lot going on in there, but it has trouble sharing that information with other computers.  Except we're even worse then that, since there's no way that speech or text can deliver 2400 bits of information per second.   Some people think that we're eventually going to overcome that with technology like brain-computer interfaces; it'll be interesting to see if that happens.   "

Unfortunately, at your age and apparently in your social group, you are only exposed to the idiots. In most adult groups it is perfectly normal for a few people to drink little, or nothing, even when they normally do. People have to drive home, people have to go home and look after their children, people are on medications, are pregnant, have work in the morning, have work directly after the social event, etc. Any mature group of adults will absolutely accept someone not drinking.\n\nNone of this really changed my view though.. it was exposure to people within casual drug culture that did. \n\nYou see, we should absolutely be treating alcohol and other drugs. The problem however isn't with how we view alcohol. It's with how we treat people who are addicts of other drugs. \n\nCasual drug use, like casual alcohol use, can be absolutely fine when used in a sensible setting with people you know. We live in a society that is barely beginning to properly treat addictions in general, however alcoholism is probably the best understood and treated out there. While we could say that addiction tobacco is up there, we're increasingly treating it as if shaming and banning can \"protect people\" from their own choices. This is exactly the problem with how we treat \"illegal\" drugs and the last thing we need is for alcohol to go this way as well.\n\nA far more effective way of handling these issues, is to accept and legalize their existence, tax, and care for those rare individuals that.. under that system.. have addiction issues.

Drinking in excess harms people. \n\nIf alcohol is to be banned, do you think car accidents would stop? Or crime/robbery?

Raising the legal limit, requiring stricter rules for getting a liquor/beer license, limiting the places someone could drink legally, raising the penalties for abusing alcohol, increased awareness through educational campaigns, etc have not even been considered, let alone thought through completely before simply thrown out with the bathwater by placing it on the same level, as say meth."

    "rejected": "&gt;At the end of the day, the decision made by the supreme courts has very limited application.\n\nWell, that's not entirely true. The justices that were part of the majority opinion **think** it is limited application and mentioned that in their decision. The minority, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg don't agree. Ironically, the very fact that Ruth Bader Ginsburg mentioned in her dissent means that justices could try to apply it more broadly, citing that a Supreme Court Justice believes it may be applicable.\n\n&gt;It only applies to companies that are owned at least 50% by 5 or fewer people.\n\nAccording to a study done in 2000 by the Copenhagen Business School, about 90% of companies in the United States are \"Closely Held\".\n\nIn 2009, a research paper from the NYU Stern School of Business, they found that \"Closely Held\" businesses apply for 52% of employment and 51% of private sector output in the country.\n\nSo... that's a large number of people.\n\n&gt;This basically means that if you and your family own a company that gets large enough that you can sell some of it to raise capital, you can still run it according to your values. This doesn't mean a company the size of apple could do the same thing.\n\nActually, if a small number of people managed to get over 50% of the Apple Company, they COULD become a \"Closely Held\" business.\n\n&gt;It is also almost completely being neglected that it only applies to 4 types of birth control. They didn't limit coverage for all preventative birth control measures, only a few retroactive ones that they consider to be similar to abortion.\n\nWhile I agree that people are assuming they don't allow ANY Birth Control, the fact remains that by law they *were* supposed to be covering those four as well. The Healthcare law that passed set a baseline for insurance policies, and those included those four types of birth control.\n\n&gt;People are also under no obligation to work for these companies.\n\nIn the same way that black people are under no obligation to work for companies that discriminate against black people. But, companies can't **do** that because it is against the law. Although it works in principle, what about towns with a very limited amount of jobs? Or how about Unemployment Benefits which might cut out if you refuse to take a job you were offered, due to your personal principles?\n\n&gt;Likely, the people who work for these companies work there because they share the values of the company, and thus aren't affected by the decision.\n\nOr it could be that they need a job. America is finally getting out of what some were saying was the biggest recession since the Great Depression. For lots of people, they may not have the luxury of being picky with a job. Should they rather go on unemployment?\n\nEven if they DO agree with management about their personal opinions regarding abortion and these specific pills, a person can't *force* you to think that way.\n\n&gt;Some people make the argument that it's a slippery slope, which is a logical fallacy. It doesn't open some Pandora's box.\n\nWhy doesn't it? Just because the 5 Supreme Court Justices in the Majority Opinion don't think it does?\n\n&gt;If it did though, if the world worked that way, I would rather have the box opened that could lead to more individual freedom from governmental power, than the box that would be opened with an opposite ruling: opening the door for the government to impose laws on anyone regardless of their ideological stances.\n\nThe Government of the United States is a Representative Democracy based on a Constitution and Bill of Rights which guarantee rights to everyone.\n\nYou think that the Minority Opinion would be encroaching on individual rights. I (and probably everyone who sides with the Minority Opinion) would view it instead as protection from a religious entity.\n\nThis may seem weird, but in reality one of the ONLY things that has higher precedence than majority opinion is how it affects the civil rights of individuals (especially the minority).\n\nA Church may believe that they have the right to torture and kill non-believers, but the Government has a *fundamental responsibility* to **limit** their right to do so if it infringes on other people.\n\nAnd that's what it basically comes down to. The religious owners of Hobby Lobby wanted to avoid following a law. One of the laws that businesses implicitly agree to follow in order to do business in the United States of America. A law that was passed to guarantee that any person, no matter what their status or who their employer was, would be guaranteed at LEAST a minimum amount of Healthcare. Now, those people can be given LESS than the minimum.\n\n&gt;Why isn't that comparable to mandating prayer in private schools?\n\nI don't understand what you mean by this. Do you mean public schools?"

    "chosen": "Well, just because they aren't a legal resident doesn't mean they don't pay any taxes. Of the 12 million, about 9 million pay some form of income tax, the IRS even has a special form for people to file taxes without the government being able to then come after them for being undocumented. That also doesn't count sales tax, property tax, gas tax, cigarette/alcohol tax, these are very big parts of funding local schools and health care. That also doesn't factor in the economic benefit they have by creating demand for goods and services, and providing a cheap source of labor which make things cheaper for everyone. \n\nBut the reason so many come here is *not for our services but our opportunity*. Guatamala for example has an average income that is equivalent (when adjusted for cost of living) to making $5,200 in the US before taxes. If you work 60h/week, 50 weeks a year, that's the equivalent of being paid $1.73/h. The average hourly wage for undocumented workers are around $3.75/h, that's more than double what they make at home *even when you factor in higher cost of living.* It's closer to tripple if you don't factor in cost of living. They are coming to the US the same reason our parents or grand parents did, for the chance at a better life than they had in their home country.\n\nEdit: And lastly, there's a reason Americans get these services. Universal education is good for everyone because then people aren't illiterate (and therefore not able to be productive). Emergency healthcare is good for everyone because then people who could otherwise continue to live and be productive aren't dead from preventable deaths. Fire and police protection is good, because ignoring either one can have spillover affects for the whole city. It isn't just a moral obligation, that can be debated. It *is* however in the economic best interests of everyone to provide basic services to non-citizens for the same reason it's in our economic best interest to provide services to citizens.",
    "rejected": "Your three examples of government services are targeted heavily towards children. Many of those children were born on United States soil and are legally US citizens. In this case the reason we do this is because those kids are one of us. That their parent's crossed the border illegally does not change that. The idea that the sins of the father are not visited upon the son is one of the most fundamental principles of American law. \n\nAs for the general argument about it being a drain on the economy: The reason people cross into the US it because of economic opportunity. In a society based around wage workers people migrate to were the jobs are. Government services have very little influence on this. If they're going to come here without regard to services the question becomes which costs less. Schooling costs money. High rates of education increase the standard of living for the entire community, which actually improves the economy. Low rates of schooling increase crime rates, lower overall physical health for the entire community and has many other negative impacts which drain the economy. The same pattern holds true for health care and nutrition. The idea that these programs are a drain on the economy is a myth. They actually create a measurable improvement on the economy."

    "chosen": "Why did you pick knitting? And why did he pick ASOIAF/GOT?\n\nIf you're sharing hobbies and he picked a book series, well, that's not exactly a hobby, but maybe it means he considers the books part of him, and feels somewhat rejected that you don't like them. I think it's also possible (speaking as someone whose ex-wife loved knitting even though knitting is literally the most boring thing in the world) (no offense) that what he actually likes about knitting isn't knitting itself but feeling closer to you by sharing these things you love, and that when you refuse to share back, it feels like the thing he liked about knitting basically evaporates.\n\nI can't exactly offer a defense of ASOIAF that will make a difference to you, because the things you dislike are obviously part of the work and those elements remain part of the work throughout. But I can tell you how I like the books in part because of those elements, without enjoying those elements, and for me the initial appeal of the story was a lot like the appeal of China's three kingdoms period, where the whole world was a machine that ground up the virtuous and the vicious alike, generation after generation, and the \"winners\" were just the ones that managed to dance on top of the gears for awhile before falling in. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, no single character survives more than 2/3 of the book, so something like Game of Thrones is actually pretty humane.\n\nWesteros is not a just world. People don't get what they deserve except from luck or strength, but luck runs out and strength fades. People use each other constantly. Sticking to the first book and backstory, Joffrey kills Ned to show off his power (when, it should be said, Cersei was prepared to be merciful), Tywin forces Cersei to marry Robert, Robert forces Jaime to stand outside the bedroom door to get off on getting away with sleeping around on Jaime's sister, Lysa forces Vardis to continue fighting and die (even after he has clearly lost), etc. There is definitely a general asymmetry in the way the powerful use power over women, versus the way the powerful use power over men (though you will find exceptions in both directions if you keep reading), but to me this seems to be in keeping with the feminist understanding that rape is about power, and ultimately almost everybody just treats other people as objects to be used, and the exceptions (like Syrio's sacrifice for Arya) are noteworthy for being rare.\n\nWhy is this appealing? Because actual life and real history are awful and it's a relief to find a fantasy that doesn't pretend otherwise. If you read a fantasy where the wicked are punished and childhoods are happy, doesn't that just make real life more depressing?\n\nANYHOW, back to your situation with your husband. It's dicey because I don't think he would have picked ASOIAF if it didn't mean a lot to him, and there's no way to stop reading without his feeling somwehat rejected. The best way I can think to explain this to your husband is by analogy. Imagine sitting in a nicely lit room, and then imagine sitting in the same nicely lit room with a bad hangover. There's nothing wrong with the room, or with people who like sitting in the room, but you don't want to be there, because you can't stop focusing on the light, and the light is painful. When you have a hangover, the room is unpleasant. It's sweet that he wants your company in that nicely lit room, but surely he doesn't want you barfing on the sofa and would rather you feel better, even if that means you can't keep him company there.\n\nAnd finally, maybe find a more interesting hobby. :P",

If you don't enjoy his writing style then I can't really change that. What I have noticed about myself and is presumably true of others is that when I don't like the themes of a book I am much more critical of its writing style (lookin' at you Ayn Rand). I also know I see people criticising both style and content at the same time more often than I see people criticise one and praise the other. Maybe you do this too?\n\nOn to the themes:\n\n&gt; rape scenes, references to rape, gang rape, threats of rape, senseless nudity, high percentage of female characters who are prostitutes, sexual assault on any character but especially those who are minors,\n\nMartin doesn't want to hide parts of his characters lives from us. People have a lot of sex, and so do Martins characters. And unfortunately rape happens. Especially during wartime, and especially in societies where women are denied agency. I don't see how Martin can express this tragedy better than by describing it. I mean, there are plenty of strongly feminist novels that deal with rape and describe rape and we hardly call them mysogynist. Prostitution was pretty common during the Middle Ages, hence its inclusion. Keep in mind that during the Middle Ages there was no conception of a minor. People certainly wern't having sex with children, but teenagers were considered adults. Also Joffrey is what we would consider a minor.\n\nPlenty of fantasy presents a whitewashed medieval setting full of rightful princes, love marriages and wars where all the suffering is done on the battlefield. Martin offers something a little closer to reality even if his setting is only pseudo-medieval.\n\n&gt; constant references to a non-gender-conformist character as ugly and homely\n\nBrienne right? I actually think thats one of the strengths of Briennes character. Too often in fantasy I feel like female characters are allowed to be skilled warriors or talented mages or clever theives as long as they are still hot. They arn't given the muscles you need to weild a heavy metal sword and wear heavy metal armour and they are expected to contort themselves in such a way as to show off their arse and boobs at the same time while fighting off skeletons or whatever. Briennes character defies gender roles both through her actions in becoming a knight and through defying the expectations of beauty her society, and our society place on her. Also I don't think Martin directly calls Brienne ugly or homely although he may describe her with features we think of as ugly or homely. Other characters call her ugly, and I think she has internalized that message.\n\n&gt; He had the opportunity to create a new world, one that is not ours and could have its own rules, and for some reason for the sake of 'realism' opted to set it in a pseudo-medieval setting.\n\nMartin is not obliged to write that book, and you are not obliged to read Martins books. Martin isn't trying to offer a society with gender roles we should aspire to, and he doesn't have to. Other authors can do that if they want. There is room in this world for both utopian fantasy and dystopian fantasy.\n\nMaybe Game of Thrones is not for you. But that does not make Game of Thrones a bad novel. Maybe if you really can't stand it you need to find some other way to compromise with your fiancee. "

Most of us know that war is a terrible thing that takes away the lives of many of our young members of society. I know no one who glorifies it, and the \"armchair generals\" you speak of don't actually affect the armies of the United States.\n\nHere, my argument would generally go to \"we don't need any more soldiers,\" but since you aren't arguing that, I won't argue it either.\n\nI personally couldn't stand the thought of one of my family being forced to go to war and not coming back. My grandfather already paid the ultimate price when my mother was a very young child, and my father had been stationed all over the world before joining the reserves here in Georgia.

I \"understand the gravity behind going to war\" very well, and I haven't seen a bit of combat.\n\nInstead of forced conscription, I think a better avenue would be, as I always think, educating the people about war, which is far less time-consuming and resource-intensive. Which brings me to my next topic: cost. According to that [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States) I linked earlier, we will have nearly 4 million new 18 year olds next year. Can you imagine the cost and logistics of training 4 million people each year?

If I were raising a national army, I'd definitely want my fighting force to be as uniform as possible in their opinions, and frankly, I would want them to think for themselves as little as possible, so the more homogeneity the better. The American public is totally out of touch with combat and bloodshed, but that's kind of the point, isn't it? This there's one thing America is great at, it's that kind of stuff.\n\nThe cannon-fodder days are over. We're a huge, wealthy country with a boundless high-tech arsenal. We don't need everyone to join the armed forces. What would the military gain from that other than servicepeople who by and large don't want to be there? Bad for business. The military would benefit from a more diverse group of people just to bring more skills into the fold, but 18 year olds almost never have any skills anyway.\n\nWhat are some moral reasons that would be acceptable or unacceptable?"

Saying EVs shouldn't be mass produced because they're too expensive is tantamount to saying they shouldn't be mass produced because they're not mass produced. Circular logic at its finest.\n\n&gt;Sourcing of some materials (lead has been phased out, still reliant of rare earth metals though)\n\n[This is false](http://www.plugincars.com/rare-earth-elements-arent-actually-necessary-evs-or-hybrids-107194.html). Teslas in particular don't use any rare earth elements.\n\n&gt;Typically challenging to recycle\n\nThis is unfounded. There's really nothing objective that can be said about recycling yet, since EVs are still too new. But there's every reason to believe that once large numbers of depleted EV batteries exist it will make more sense to recycle them than to just junk them.\n\n&gt;Won't work on current infrastructure for a decade or two on a mass scale\n\nThe beauty of EVs is that the infrastructure is *already there*. EVs can plug in to any existing electrical outlet, or tap into the existing grid supply with relatively minor effort. Contrast adding a bunch of simple charging stations to something like building out an entirely new hydrogen production and distribution infrastructure.\n\n&gt;Burden on non electric purchasers\n\nSee point #1 - The whole idea of the tax credit is to spur mass-production, which will then bring the cost down and therefore render the tax credit unnecessary. Also the law already provides for the sunsetting of the credit once a certain number of EVs per manufacturer have claimed it.\n\n&gt;Artificial cost due to fleet standards lowering the cost of EVs and Hybrids\n\nYou can't evaluate fleet standards (also applies to above tax credit discussion) in a vacuum. What about the burdens imposed on *everybody* by the production and operation of *gasoline* powered vehicles? The costs associated with securing, shipping, refining, and ultimately combusting gasoline in automobiles are ENORMOUS, and almost completely dissociated from the price paid for gas-powered automobiles or at the pump.\n\n&gt;Pointless if the energy comes from coal\n\nYou rightly point out how coal's usage is typically overstated (it's currently at about 40% of the U.S. mix), but you're wrong to say that there would be no benefits from transitioning our transportation energy from oil to coal. You're thinking only in terms of environmental harm - in which case, sure **if** electricity were 100% coal-powered it'd pretty much be a wash. But what about the ramifications to the U.S. economy and national security of transitioning from oil, a **largely imported** energy source, to 100% domestically sourced coal?\n\n&gt;High cost of replacing the battery every 5-10 years\n\nLike the recycling issue, all talk of battery replacement is so far based only on speculation. And like the subsidy/regulation issue, you can't look at this in a vacuum. While battery replacement may be expensive, what about the near **complete lack** of other maintenance EVs require relative to ICE vehicles? No oil changes, no transmissions, belts, spark plugs, smog checks, and so on. Even the brakes wear much more slowly.\n\n&gt;Current low production of rare earth metals will restrict the mass production of electric vehicles until production picks up\n~Dependence on foreign nations for some rare-earth metals\n\nAlready pointed out the flaw in these arguments.\n\n&gt;Many vehicles simply demand too much energy to be battery powered\n\nThe fact that EVs can't replace ICEs in *every* niche is no reason whatsoever not to mass-produce them for the many niches where they are far superior to ICEs.\n\n&gt;Many purchasers of EVs simply purchase the vehicles as a status symbol with no actual care for the environment\n\nThis is irrelevant. It matters not *why* individual consumers buy EVs, only that they *do.* Every mile driven on electricity rather than gasoline is a good thing, regardless of individual motivations.\n\n&gt;In some areas, EVs contribute to congestion\n\nYou are misinformed. Granting carpool access to EVs [actually improves overall traffic, according to a Berkeley study.](https://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2011/10/10/hybrids-carpool-study/) Also, EVs are more than 2x as efficient as the average car, so unless that 2-person carpool is in a Prius it's probably still \"greener\" to have someone riding solo in an EV.\n\n&gt;We need to continue our work on energy storage, production, and delivery first. After these aspects have been improved, then we can begin the mass production of EVs again.\n\nAs you yourself pointed out, \"mass production fuels innovation.\" Research is great, but only real production effects change. Even if EVs still aren't perfect, they're already much better than the alternative. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\n\n\n"

It would also indicate that they didn't really have a choice in the matter because they were subjected to a limited population with whom to form relationships.\n\nThat's the argument I've been using for a long time.",
    "rejected": "&gt; marriage is not about reproduction. \n\nThis is true, and I'll grant that a key component of the recent ruling was that marriage cannot be distinguished based on a couple's ability to have, or preference for, children. So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there's a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. \n\nI imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it's wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children.

IMO that's not \"deserving\" to fall, it's just the first steps of being taken down. The Jedi had kept order for-- how many millenia?-- without anyone ever needing or wanting to revolt.\n\nAs far as keeping celibate goes, that's a pretty common religious order, so it shouldn't be that big a deal. If you're going to bring the EU into it, things get way more wonky, but at the least we can say with that *extra* information, we now don't have enough information to pass judgment. Maybe only members of the Jedi Order can take wives? Maybe there are certain conditions that need to be met?\n\nAt the end of the day, I think you're right that the Jedi Order was doing more harm than good-- *but* I don't think they deserved to fall, I think they already were. What they deserved is a hero/savior to free them from the evil manipulation, what they got instead was a powerful warlord who took them down.\n\nLet's look at it this way. In the US, we've had shitty Presidents, right? Does that mean our government deserves to fail because one guy in control is ruining things? Do we seek national revolution any time our leader does something wrong? No. We get rid of the person doing the wrongdoing and do our best to right the wrongs that he made happen.",

Using a different discipline doesn't justifies automatic death penalty\n\nI like to mark the difference between sith and jedi, not by the dark and white distinction, but on their fundamental points of view on life.\n\nA sith will think in absolutes and can't be reasoned with.\nA jedi is open minded and tries to reason first. Because that's what adults do, life is not black and white.\nThat's how I judge a good guy from a bad guy in real life anyways.\n\nNow let's apply this. Who was a sith and who was a jedi? Answer: Qui-gon, Anakin and Luke were Jedi. The rest proved to be a sith, white or black. Qui-gon was a clearer Jedi than Anakin, that's for sure. Anakin was pretty dark. Luke is pretty grey. He force choked and killed a lot of peoples, but always tried reasoning first and was a pretty good guy overall.\n\nSee here's the difference. Qui-Gon tried to reason peoples, even the jedi council. Anakin tried to reason the emperor and wanted to until the very end of his jedi career (Windu's death) and Luke, when he was a jedi, went to jabba, went to Vader and the emperor, always to reason with them. The whole rest of them: You don't share my point of view?! Pew Pew! Die! Die! I'm white thus I'm good! Don't touch that titties Skywalker, it'll turn you \"bad force\" and I'll have to kill you on the spot!\n\nTl;dr: Vader did not restore balance to the force by balancing the number of jedi and siths.

    "prompt": "Basketball is a poorly designed sport and is not fun to watch. CMV",
    "chosen": "It seems as though every qualm you have sited about the sport of basketball stems from the pace of the game. Every single possession in basketball must end with a missed basket, a turnover, or points all within a 24 second period; because of this fast-paced aspect of the game, the opportunities to score are greatly increased especially when taking into consideration the size of the playing field is 94' x 50', which, needless to say, doesn't even come close to the football field, baseball field, or soccer pitch. Hence, there is an urgency to score points as the window in which to score is greatly reduced per possession and the offensive team is essentially immediately placed in front of the spot where points are scored. Imagine if every football possession started on the 20-yard line of the defensive team and the offense had 1 minute to score.\n\nSo, you are right, there are lots of points scored, but that is the nature of the game. If there was no shot clock and no urgency to shoot and score points it is almost guaranteed that the scores would be a lot lower. However, because of the high rate of scoring, basketball becomes more about a game of momentum. When teams string together successful possessions with 8-0 runs two aspects of the game are affected simultaneously and noticeably. From one team’s perspective, they are not making shots due to poor offense with turnovers and/or missed shots while playing poor defense and not stopping the other team. Other sports don’t necessarily have this level of perceptible momentum that readily is observed through the scoreboard. Football does have these swings in momentum, but it often takes a considerable amount of time to produce results on the scoreboard as the field is so large and scoring comes at a much slower clip as each PLAY is within 35 seconds whereas each SCORE in basketball is within 24 seconds.\n\nMany games are decided within 2 or 3 points; 2 or 3 baskets. But I hardly think that is any reason to disregard the rest of the points scored. When a score is tied 90-90 with 2 minutes left it has to be thought of as this: Each team has been able to respond to each others offensive and defensive plays and stops. In relation to baseball, every out recorded was met by the other team, and every run was met with one of one’s own. But if a game is tied 2-2 in the 8th should we erase everything that happened in innings 1-7? Your argument of the value of each score is completely valid; however, a basketball team with the ball with 10 seconds left in a tie game has just as every respective opportunity to win as a baseball team tied with its opponent with 3 outs in the bottom of the ninth. The difference undoubtedly is in the probability of scoring and thus winning, but this probability is simply, once again, a determinant of the pace and rate of scoring. The chances a basketball team scores a basket to win a game in the last 10 seconds is greater than a baseball team scoring a run in the last half of an inning. This is simply the nature of each game. Because of this, I would argue that there is more excitement in that last ten seconds of basketball than in the last half inning of baseball as I know there is a greater chance of scoring and end of the game. This probability of scoring carries over to the rest of basketball when a team is down by 10 points or more. I know there is a decent chance that the team down by 10 points will catch some form of momentum that will bring things back to even.\n\nYour sentiments that the game is too back-and-forth is part of what makes it worth watching even when a team is down by many points. Big leads in soccer, football, hockey, and baseball have varying but significantly lesser chances of once again becoming even. The uncertainty in basketball of holding a lead—especially in the playoffs when there are proven teams capable of ending the opposing team’s lead—makes the idea of a big lead less impenetrable.\n\nYour ego argument feels personally seeded. I don’t entirely know how to respond to that because a player playing for his ego often ends in a loss as a player can rarely take every shot and expect to win. Carmelo Anthony shoots a lot and scores a lot and is widely considered an \"all star,\" but his playoff record against the best teams in the league is dreadful. Rudy Gay shot 11-37 at one point this season, he subsequently was traded. Selfish play is prevalent in many sports. Just look at Dez Bryant in today’s NFL. The difference in the NBA is the impact a single player has on the game. Basketball has 10 players total on the floor at once where each one plays both defense and offense. If a player decided to take a bunch of plays off, he/she is going to get beat and the team will suffer. A left fielder in baseball may never touch the ball in live play. Successful, winning basketball has every player involved in every play save specific situations. So, when a player hogs the ball and plays only offense (which tends to be the case with ego, cause, who expresses their ego through defense??) their team will certainly suffer. Even when players do score lots of points off of lots of shots and has a good shooting percentage there is still a decent chance of losing. Just look at Kevin Love’s recent 45 point effort in a loss, or Kyrie Irving’s 40 point effort last night in a loss. This is not to say that these players have egos, as I do not think they do, but those types of efforts, which many egocentric players produce night after night, do not always end in wins. If you are saying that this ego-based style of play is what makes that game bad, you have probably been following the wrong teams. The Knicks are what I consider to be the worst team in the league currently in terms of ego. They also happen to be 9-19. Bottom line is that basketball naturally gravitates towards egos since one single player can so readily affect the game. In addition, the ego is easy to see as it is constantly on the floor and is constantly present in every play, which directly relates back to the pace of the game. With that, I would suggest watching better-rounded teams that play collectively on a high level. The Spurs and the Trailblazers are two teams that currently represent excellent team play.\n\nFouls are a necessary evil that keep the scores at what they are. I disagree with your opinion that less fouls would lead to a better game; I assume that the source of your opinion on fouls comes from the assumption that less fouls will equal less points as it is harder to score which will make points more valuable which will make the sport more watchable as possessions mean more and the quality of shot attempts mean more. Hard fouls on shot attempts would lead to some really ridiculous situations. Getting a 24.2cm ball through a 45.72cm ring becomes increasingly difficult the further from the hoop you get. Inhibiting one’s ability to make a shot through physical grabbing and holding as a legal part of the game would be a little like kicking or holding a player’s leg as he tries to kick a soccer ball into a net. There is much variety in how a person can be fouled on a shot and because of this there needs to be a relatively simple way of policing it because as it is with most sports, the speed of the game makes it difficult for refs to get everything right at game speed. If you were referring to “touch” fouls and little stuff not involved with shots, I would say those fouls are more involved with more easily allowing players to get open and take shots and actually score points. It would be hard to catch a football if someone was holding one or both arms. \n\nIn all, basketball is a fast sport. The possessions are high because the rules make it that way. The scores are high because of the size of the playing field and the way in which the game places the offenders easily, directly, and quickly within reach of the hoop. The sport attracts egos because one player can have such a big impact where one can quickly be labeled a “star”, but that doesn’t always translate to wins. I would simply recommend not watching certain “stars” that do not encapsulate both defensive and offensive aspects in attempts to win. Fouls are necessary in keeping such a break neck pace in check while not making it highly improbable to score. Basketball is a fast game. The pace dictates everything from the scores to the fouls to the importance of every player in playing on both sides of the ball.\n\nI do not agree that it is poorly designed; it just seems to be too fast for your liking. I find the scoring and speed to make the game very exciting as close games in the last 2 minutes can truly be anyone’s game.\n\nEDIT: Carmelo's playoff W-L is bad. http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2012/05/carmelo-anthonys-playoff-record-is-nbas-worst-in-20-years/1#.Ur4i9GQU2dM \n",
    "rejected": "How do you feel about other high scoring games like Aussie Rules Football or Cricket? I've never been a huge fan of cricket, takes a little too long for my tastes, but ARF has tons of scoring and that has never deterred me from watching it.\n\nI feel if you are just looking at how much scoring is being done then you're looking at the game wrong or trying to appreciate it for the wrong reasons, so I'll try to break it down.\n\n&gt; A basket is kind of nice, but it's nothing special. In baseball or sports where you score a goal, each goal or point or run matters.\n\nIn basketball, each basket you score does matter. While some games end in blowouts, many games are decided by a few points, which means every trip down the court is important. Missing a couple of easy open shots in the first quarter could come back to bite you at the end of the game.\n\nDoes it matter that there is more scoring than other sports? It shouldn't, it just means you need to approach the game differently. Every time you come down the court your goal is to score a basket, just like in every other sport, but it just so happens the scoring percentage is much higher. I think part of the problem, especially in the NBA, is that the players are so skilled offensively they make it look easy when it really isn't. Ideally you want to get an open shot or an open lane to the rim for an easy bucket, but you need to be very quick and take opportunities that last for less than seconds and need to make the judgement on the spot. What makes the sport enjoyable to watch is seeing them make those quick decisions and hit a good shot, or seeing them working with what they got and making a contested play anyway.\n\n&gt; The other problem is the fouls. God, the fouls. You can't touch another player without the whistle being blown\n\nI assume you hate soccer even more, there is even less touching allowed in that game. Basketball allows some amount of physical contact, but if you let guys that big bump each other harder on a hardwood court you'd have way too many injuries, it just can't be done. \n\nI'm not against physical contact in sports though, all my favourite sports have it. I watch hockey all the time, rugby when I can get it and the CFL when it is in season. Those games are made to support contact in a much safer way.\n\nSo what's the appeal in the sport then? It's highly skilled based, usually has a bunch of very acrobatic or athletic plays made throughout, and while it is high scoring is usually very competitive throughout, as long as the teams matched up are of equal calibre, but that last point can be made for most sports."

    "prompt": "I believe public welfare does more harm than good. CMV",
    "chosen": "I have no real knowledge about the American public welfare system, so please pardon any eventual ignorance from my part. I'll try to argue from my experience as someone that was born in Brazil, spent my childhood in Guatemala, and then moved to Sweden at the age of ten, where I reside today. I have gone from living in a privileged position in a country with virtually **zero** public welfare, to a low-middle class on in the country that probably has the most extensive public welfare system in the world. \n\n&gt; I believe that government support simply creates a culture of laziness and a mentality of entitlement. When someone has to fend for themselves, they become stronger. When someone else feeds them, they lose the ability to feed themselves. \n\nIn a sense, you are right. It does make people feel entitled to what they consider to be fundamental rights, as virtue of being human. It makes people believe that no children should have a lesser opportunity in life based on the fact that they where born in the wrong family. It makes people outraged if a child should be denied a qualitative education, healthcare, or decent living conditions based on where they are born and what monetary means their parents happen to have. \n\nAnd in a sense, it also makes them lazy. Whilst I was attending school, peers of my same age with poorer families (often of mayan decent) in Guatemala would go from street light to street light doing circus tricks for money (a very common and vivid memory from my childhood) or helping their parents out in the field. In order for their families to survive, they had to work hard from the moment they where able to. One of the cleaning ladies at my mothers office, who later became a close friend of the family, only passed third grade. And she is not some isolated incident: as late is 2011, only [30%](http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/guatemala.htm) of those attending the primary level of education graduate from it. That's the drop-out rate for the high school level of education in Sweden. An education they are not only given for free (in Guatemala, this stops at year 6) - they are also given meals, books and transportation. \n\nIf society has a good, well functioning safety net, people don't have to only focus on surviving. They can send their kids to school, knowing that they will be fed a meal. If they get laid off, or have a bad year in the fields, they don't have to pull the kids from school in order to work. If there is guaranteed standard of living, children can realize their full potential, regardless of background. \n\nSo I believe that you are right - in a society without welfare, people are carved into rigid, strong individuals fending for themselves at young age in order to survive that harsh, dog eat dog world they live in. While we citizens of the nany state do not know how it is to work at young age, come to expect certain standards and become \"weaker\". \n\nThing is, I would much rather live in the later society. \n\n&gt;It makes people complacent and less likely to push themselves to learn new skills and persevere.\n\nThis I must disagree with. According to this [study](http://martinprosperity.org/media/GCI%20Report%20Sep%202011.pdf), all four Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) are consistently ranked among the top 10 nations in the world when it comes to Innovation, Technology, Talent, Research and \"Creative class share\" (whatever that is). Other countries with consistent top-10 placements in that list are the USA and Canada. That's no fluke. \n\n&gt;I would argue that the last one is the one most likely to help them get a better job, but people are lazy because of the entitlement culture here in the US.\n\nOr they simply like their current job. \n\nAlso, all forms of higher education are free in Scandinavia, and you are actually given handouts for studying. This does not mean that everyone will become a physicist at CERN, it only means that everyone has an equal opportunity to it. And isn't that what the American dream is supposed to be about? \n\n&gt;They truly believe that they deserve something for nothing. They think the world owes them something.\n\nThey are paying it with their taxes, taxes they themselves have paid. It's not something for nothing - it's their hard work that lays the foundation for their social security.",

Maybe they can't afford to stop working, for example? (a common reason why people don't study for a better job)\n\n&gt; I believe that this mentality is caused by welfare programs.\n\nI believe it's caused by the American Dream, the great expectations of becoming successful just for being in america. It attracts entitled people who think just because they were lucky enough to have a career or start a business without meeting any obstacles, that they got there through *hard work* and everyone else is just *lazy and entitled*.\n\n&gt; On a somewhat different note, I also believe that corporate welfare is just as terrible, if not worse. It props up businesses that should fail. It allows major corporations to make destructive decisions that can harm the whole economy.\n\nSometimes bailouts are necessary to prevent massive harm to the economy in the short term, IMO the error is when they turn into long-term \"solutions\" instead of getting phased out.\n"

The GDP would remain the same because the government no longer is allowed to tax for chronic illness in the proposed system. The government would still keep the same amount of usable revenue because of an equal decrease in expenditures and an equal decrease in revenue.\n\nIn addition to this, chronic illness can range from ~~mile~~ mild to immediate death upon removal of medication. Those people who have chronic asthma aren't really burdening society, but their malady can still be classified as chronic. How does one draw the line between that and something more severe, like crohn's disease? Some people who would otherwise be happily be living would be killed in the name of euthanization. If the government was to apply this same principle to other minority groups, the government might as well kill all seniors over 80 years of age. Obviously, they were suffering from old age, right? 80 years is definitely the right cutoff age and is definitely not an arbitrarily drawn number, right?"

    "prompt": "Child Protective Services (CPS), while a good concept, is virtually useless in practice",
    "chosen": "Nearly everything you have described is an issue with existing laws, not CPS. As an organization, CPS can only receive custody after a court order. If a caseworker knocks on a door, there is no legal obligation of the parent to open it. The most that the caseworker could do is document the situation and present it in court, where a judge can order the parent to comply. The only time CPS can get custody right away is if law enforcement drops the child off (called LAW status, or Officer Acceptance), and even then requires a formal court hearing within 24 hours for it to \"stick.\"\n\nPoint being, the reason you don't see CPS walking away with more kids is because the court/laws do not allow them to. \n\nIn regards to pregnant mothers taking drugs, I absolutely agree that that should count as child abuse. However, it legally doesn't in many states. [Here is an article from 2014](http://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-charged-controversial-law-criminalizes-drug-pregnancy/story?id=24542754) talking about the \"controversial\" use of a law to charge a pregnant mom with assault. What used to happen in 2013? Presumably nothing. If no \"crime\" took place, why would the courts grant CPS custody? \n\nBelieve me, I completely understand how frustrating it must seem to make reports and nevertheless see these horrible excuses for parents take babies home to what will inevitably amount to shitty home situations. But 99% of the time, that caseworker doesn't want the child going home either - there just wasn't enough legal standing to keep them. It isn't illegal to make your kids sleep on the floor, nor is it illegal to smack then around as long as you don't leave a mark. These are the short of limitations CPS are shackled with. \n\nOn top of, you know, low budgets, high turnover, and a population that largely views them both as baby-snatchers and incompetent. ",
    "rejected": "Cps, the agency, isn't the problem.  The problem is that it's only as good as the funding,  legal powers,  and other resources its given.\n\nIn my state cps can't do anything about a pregnant woman using pot,  meth, or other drugs because it's not illegal.   The best they can do is monitor the situation once the baby is born.  If you should be mad at anyone,  it's a mother who does this to her own.       But if your area is like mine, addiction and mental health services are very much lacking.  Even if she wants to quit, the resources may not be there.  This is a flaw with society,  health care system,  insurance system, and government policy.\n\nI'm sure there are children living in terrible conditions.   But couldn't that be prevented without immediately removing kids?  For example if it's rats in a rental, why isn't the landlord being forced to take immediate action?  If it's a sanitary issue, why isn't the health department taking action?   The entire family shouldn't be living like that. \n\nI sincerely believe a lot of mistreatment and neglect can be attributed to a parent with mental health issues.   Taking the kid away for six months won't fix the parent.  What we need is effective, accessible,  affordable,  unstigmatized mental health care.   In my county for example, we have a single clinic providing mental health for low income / medicaid -- one.  My county has zero mental health clinics or facilities that specialize in pediatrics.    We don't have a single drug/alcohol rehab in the whole county,  except the one methadone clinic.    Anxiety disorder affects 18% of the adult population;  major depression 6% ([source]( http://www.adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics) ).   Instead of breaking up families, let's put the money into fixing why adults are having behavioral problems.\n\nThere's also a cultural belief system that holds cps and the courts from having more power:  that every person has the right to have kids and that being a biologic parent is far more important than a non-biologic fit parent.     Until the courts and society become more tolerant of severing biological parents rights,  cps is very limited.  It's the same court system that will put a kid back with a parent with criminal abuse charges for \"another chance\" rather than award custody to a relative.   And when a parent has to leave an abusive partner,  it's extremely hard to get visitation rights severed even with proof of mistreatment.      Everyone is so scared of violating violating \"parents rights\" that kids rights are overlooked. "

If you feel you are inherently \"not worthy\" due to the vast scale and general nature of the universe, etc., you have misunderstood the very nature of \"worthiness\". To seek confirmation of some innately human value from the universe itself is inherently irrational, and inherently bound to be fruitless. It's about as rational as asking your kitchen table or an orange to assert your worth as a person.

You are looking for an absolute answer to a relative question, but things don't work that way. All your \"worthiness\" as a human being will have to be determined by human beings because \"worthiness\" is something that only exists in the perception of human beings. The very concept of \"worthiness\" is only one of the many mental tools evolution has equipped us with in order to be able to function as social beings within the context of a society (the ability to do so being, of course, a prerequisite for human survival for much of our history as a species).\n\nI know it would be more convenient and more comfortable if there was some way to absolutely determine one's worth, but there isn't.

Many schools use scholarships to promote diversity, but not necessarily just racial diversity. They know that they can't get every applicant they accept to enroll in the school, so a lot of schools will pad their \"yield\" (percentage of students accepted who enroll) by offering generous merit scholarships to top students. In the same way, if a school wants to help improve its perception with regards to diversity or race relations or social justice, it's using scholarships to incentivize students with particular traits to enroll.\n\nThe scholarships that are designed for people who are not purely academic achievers were never meant for those students anyway.

Being a white male, you are statistically more likely to be in the front running for those 80 other scholarships. This is not your fault, as you didn't choose to be a white male, but the 20 people who are in the front running for the other scholarships didn't choose that either, and I'm sure if the system was fair, they would be advocating for the elimination of special requirement scholarships, but the fact of the matter is the system isn't fair. \n\nLet's take a look at the inner-city public high school system for a moment. These schools are woefully underfunded, woefully underserved, and (generally speaking) are largely minority based. Chances are the students who attend said high school will not be afforded the privileges of those who attend a more well-to-do high school in the suburbs (eg SAT/ACT prep courses, AP classes, etc.), thus making them (potentially) less likely to have the requirements necessary for certain scholarships. This is not the fault of the student, it is the fault of a broken system.\n\nLong story short, I suppose, people from traditionally more privileged heritages (eg: white males) are more likely to obtain the criteria necessary for scholarships, based purely on the failings of the public school system, and that is why race and gender based scholarships apply. Because those students who get race based scholarships prove to be just as successful at the college level, but perhaps wouldn't get the chance if not for scholarships geared towards them."

    "prompt": "I think the DOMA ruling today was badly decided. You cannot draw the connection from equal protection under the law to the unconstitutionality of a uniform definition of marriage. CMV",
    "chosen": "&gt;What am I not seeing?\n\nThe fact that there is a specific judicial analysis involved for different classifications under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection (\"E/P\") clause.  It's not simply \"Oh, well, this law discriminates or is unequal in some way so phhhhbbtt.\"  Then we wouldn't have any laws, which might be more interesting, but probably a bad idea.  In your example, musicians are not a suspect class.  The right to record music is not a fundamental right.  I'll explain why this matters below, and include a picture for ease:\n\nThe fundamental problem of E/P is that *all* laws discriminate, so it's not a vice or flaw to show a *single* law discriminates (ex. homicide discriminates against people who want to commit murder, forced retirement of policemen at a certain age discriminates against people over the retirement age, etc.)  Therefore, the state's discrimination needs to match objective state wants to achieve in some meaningful way, the extent to which is determined by the class it discriminates against or the right it alienates.\n\n[Here is an illustration of what I'm going to describe below.](http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d34/LessThanLiz/Scrutiny1_zps186af091.png)\n\nScrutiny is the standard of review a court adopts when evaluating the law in question. It effectively says \"This is the extent to which we need to examine this law, and the bar set to justify its enactment.\" Currently, we have three levels of scrutiny: rational basis (or deferential), intermediate, and strict.\n\nCertain categorizations dictate particular levels of scrutiny. Race, for example, always triggers strict scrutiny. Gender, on the other hand, only warrants intermediate scrutiny, though it has gotten to the point in some cases where it's closer to strict than anything. Age and disability trigger deferential scrutiny.\n\nTraditionally, homosexuality has occupied the area of deferential scrutiny, but in recent history, some courts have seen fit to accord it intermediate scrutiny.  Note:  this is not what occurred in *Windsor*.  Rather, the court added some more teeth to RB when it comes to analyzing encroachments on the state's ability to dictate who may marry whom.\n\nMoving homosexuality into an area of more heightened scrutiny would have big consequences, because each scrutiny level has its own test.\n\nDeferential scrutiny is exactly what is sounds like; it operates with deference towards the state and is often the least fatal evaluation of the law. The test for this is that the ends must be legitimate (not overtly unconstitutional) and the means must be reasonable. Usually, if a state invokes its police powers - as is the case with marriage laws - it will pass deferential scrutiny.\n\nIntermediate scrutiny came about during a spree of gender-based discrimination cases and has mostly been reserved for gender alone though, on some occasions, legitimacy (as in \"illegitimate\" children) as well. The test for this is that the ends must be important governmental ends and the means must be substantially related to those ends. It is more fatal than deferential scrutiny, though not as fatal as strict scrutiny.\n\nStrict scrutiny is the most fatal of all three and the biggest hurdle for the state to overcome when defending a law it has enacted. Here, the ends must be compelling and the means must be narrowly tailored. It is typically reserved for race, First Amendment cases, and fundamental rights (e.g., Equal Protection; typically reserved for race, some gender, and substantive Equal Protection such as voting access and jury service.)\n\nIt should be noted that, strict scrutiny is not always a win for the petitioners (see: *Korematsu*.)  Likewise, while deferential scrutiny is rarely ever fatal, it is not a free pass. *Romer* is an example of this. In this situation, the law in question was deemed so blatantly unconstitutional and unreasonable so as to not pass the rational basis test, primarily because the animus behind it was *malicious*.  This is from where Kennedy derived the extra \"bite\" that allowed him to find section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional, requiring the rational basis test to be accompanied by some \"careful consideration\" (what this means, we don't know yet, because he doesn't say, because we are talking about Justice Kennedy and this is just something he does.)\n\nIt's a little fuzzy in the DOMA case precisely because Kennedy didn't really elaborate on why there was a \"careful consideration\" rational basis...ish test or what it really means, but this is what [Volokh](http://www.volokh.com/2013/06/26/federalism-marries-liberty-in-the-doma-decision/) argues:\n\n&gt;1. The definition and regulation of the right to marry is traditionally the province of states (and is not among the enumerated powers of Congress.  (“The recognition of civil marriages is central to state domestic relations law applicable to its residents and citizens.” [17])\n\n&gt;2. When it enacted DOMA Congress was demonstrably intending to and did interfere with this traditional function of states to define and regulate the right to marry by raising the cost to same-sex couples of being married under state law.  (“DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to protect” [20])\n\n&gt;3. Therefore, the Court will use heightened scrutiny to evaluate the rationality of DOMA’s imposed definition of marriage (“ In determining whether a law is motived by an improper animus or purpose, ‘[d]iscriminations of an unusual character’ especially require careful consideration.”).\n\n&gt;4. **This unusual deviation from the past practice of respecting state law definitions of marriage was improperly motivated by animus.  (“The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States.” [21)**\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nHope that helps some.  Unfortunately, sloppiness doesn't really support your main point since your argument isn't really derived from any of the criticisms being lobbied at Kennedy.  There are tons of poorly written or hard-to-understand decisions out there.  They don't mean every person who disagrees with the outcome is implicitly correct, especially when the majority of the people criticizing the rationale of his decision aren't trying to defend DOMA on the grounds you have.\n\nAlso, as an aside, the rationale behind a marriage statute is almost certainly not the ability to love a person because you can do that without da law; however, without legal recognition, you can't collect your spouse's social security benefits, file jointly for federal income tax, and otherwise take advantage of the 1,000s of other federal (and state) rights that accompany legal marital status.  That's kind of a big deal.\n\nEDIT:  Oh and /u/therealshyft made another point I was going to post but he was first:  you have beef with anti-miscegenation laws?  I would hope so.  But the argument made in favor of those decades ago was much like yours:  it doesn't violate equal protection because (a)  white people also can't marry black people, and; (b)  black people can still get married, just not to white people.  The reason few people make it today is because it was refuted back then.",
    "rejected": "Justice Kennedy's ruling is not exactly as you see it. Here's the juicy bit from pg. 25:\n\n&gt;The class to which DOMA directs its restrictions and restraints are those persons who are joined in same-sex marriages made lawful by the State. DOMA singles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled to recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty. It imposes a disability on the class by refusing to acknowledge a status the State finds to be dignified and proper. DOMA instructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with whom same-sex couples interact, including their own children, that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others.\n\nStates grant marriage licenses, not the federal government. So Kennedy's ruling essentially holds that the Federal Government cannot treat certain legally married couples differently than others. \n\nKennedy ends his opinion with this: \"This opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages.\" DOMA is unconstitutional because it deprives lawfully married same-sex couples the rights and privileges enjoyed by heterosexual couples. It is essentially a federalism ruling, at least in my reading. It does not establish legal same-sex marriages across the board, which some opponents seem to think it does and which the Supreme Court in no way has the authority to do.\n\nSo again, this ruling does not render \"unconstitutional the *uniformly applied* right to marry someone of the opposite gender.\" It merely holds that where States have deemed people to be married, the Federal Government should grant them the same marriage benefits.\n\nLet me know if I can clarify please."

Parents took that away from them, and then after they took that away they also decided it was morally wrong to physically stop bullies from bullying. Their precious little baby could get hurt. The anti bullying stuff is the teachers last ditch effort to stop bullying that they see but can't stop without putting their jobs at risk. Parents who read this, if you witness your kid being a bully, slap them and tell them it's wrong. They'll get over it. The bullied individuals are generally not to blame, kids have no idea what they're doing... Even less than us \"adults\" so they pretty much try to fit in and jump on the bandwagon for some stupid thing or another every few days. Bullying is a way to be socially dominant, but these little shits don't even know what is or is not right. Their decisions are based off of what thy have known. If they know bullying is wrong and their parents teach them this and enforce it with something they understand hopefully it will be reduced."

    "chosen": "Schooling system in my country(Slovenia) is almost exactly as you described. Education is free from primary school all the way up to phd. Everything is funded by taxpayers money so basically the only thing you need to pay for are books and pens. While attending university you also get different benefits like tax reduction if you decide to work, coupons for lunch so you don't have to pay the full price for your meal, cheaper monthly tickets for public transport, etc. Schools with tuition do exist. However their courses haven't been tested yet so there is no guarantee you will get a job when you get the degree.\n\nOn the other hand such a system has considerable amount of flaws. Many people decide to abuse it for years so they enroll in a university solely for benefits, therefore they don't actually attend classes. Because of the crisis the government can't spend the same amounts of money for education, so they decided to cut teachers salaries. Consequently many of them became overburdened with responsibilities and extremely unhappy with their position, which decreased the quality of education. Many people also study for professions that don't have any demand on the market.\n\nTo sum up, free education may seem like a good idea, however it cost a lot of money for the government(ours is almost bankrupt) and decreases the quality of education for everyone.",

The quality of education was good, and the fact that it was free was a nice touch.\n\nUnfortunately there is no such thing as free lunch.  Somebody still has to pay for it.  The government that paid teachers' salaries took this money from my parents by paying them way less than free market would (most jobs were controlled by the government, so the government set salaries).  The government also was notoriously inefficient, wasting money and resources.\n\nSo I would rather pay for education directly rather than pay the government and let it pay for the education."

Gender identity: the gender a person identified as. Gender expression: all those external cues you use to determine someone's gender: their hair or clothing or jewelry, posture and the like\n\nAs for the genders you listed, my understanding of them is that being bigender is a matter of identifying as two genders (usually taken to be man and woman) simultaneously. A bigender friend of mine would always feel weird when asked to choose man or woman, as their gender identity was as both.\n\nMeanwhile genderfluid is more like a third gender that isn't man or woman or anything else, but whose gender expression often fits in with depictions of other genders. A genderfluid friend of mine always feels weird when asked to choose man or woman because they identify as neither. \n\nA similar thing occurs with genderqueer, which often forms a third gender with your traditional non-gendered displays and presentations. Genderqueer and genderfluid overlap a lot and are really close, but it generally sounds to me like genderqueer is like one gender whereas fluid is more fuzzy and, well, fluid and variable.\n\nI've never heard of anyone identifying as androgynous, I usually only see that as a descriptor that someone uses for their gender expression that's still different from their gender identity. Agender, meanwhile, is a term I've usually heard more as an identity than an expression.\n\nEssentially, a lot of the terms do overlap a lot, but they do mean different things and meanings and thus can better identify certain people.

So the language is still evolving, and similar people end up identifying with different words - but it would be kind of cruel to say to someone, \"you might identify as genderless, but agender is the official term so you have to call yourself agender\" So facebook errs in favor of inclusion (though technically I think you can put literally anything now? you can just write in what you want, I put 'person' for mine)"

In the long term they have to deal with a bloated country with an enormous demand for resources (a demand that cannot be met in a sustainable manner). In order for them to become the next superpower, they must transition into the status of a fully developed nation. \n\nBelieve it or not, their enormous population is more of a hindrance than a blessing when it comes to long term development. Aging problems (Far too many old people with not enough young people), pollution, environmental issues, it's truly a burden for any developed nation. They acknowledge this and are taking great strides in reducing birth rates, but with this comes a host of other problems. Social issues (male vs female ratio) and broader economic ones as well (4-2-1 problem).\n\nThe problem is that China's success relies on the wealth of the West. Their huge industrial capacity is great for making loads of cheap products and selling them to wealthier countries. But they lag behind technologically and socially. Their entire system of functioning as of now does not permit them to usurp the West in any significant way. Their GDP (nominal) is still half that of the US. Militarily, they aren't even close to the US. Superpowers rely on [force projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_projection) in modern warfare. In this sense, Air power and Naval power is supreme. China can't even touch the US on this front, and they aren't even close to catching up. One aircraft carrier to the US's ten. \n\nThey are growing, yes, but soon this growth will level off as they begin to catch up. They are making use of already established technologies in conjunction with their industrial capacity in order to develop. But true development requires innovation, something that is still firmly in the hands of the West. And once the US and Europe truly departs from this recession, growth there will speed up.\n\nChina could potentially already be considered a 'superpower'. However, for them to truly usurp the United States? Decades. Thirty, Forty years at least. And I believe that at that point, with influence and development will come more and more democracy.

When you are talking about important concepts like feminism, it is very important that there exists places where it is made simple and easily accessible. As a cost to this, some of the nuance is lost.\n\nI'm not saying that Buzz Feed is the Thomas Paine of feminism.

    "prompt": "I don't like music and I think I can't benefit from listening to it",
    "chosen": "So, here's the deal. Your particular post touches on a topic near and dear to my heart. NOT MUSIC, but the uses of art. I love music, but I want to approach your view from an oblique angle.\n\nI posit that **there are two ways to enjoy art** Active, and Passive. It sounds like you don't enjoy passively listening to music in the background. What about songs that require active involvement or understanding of the lyrics? Songs that require attention, and can't just be thrown on the radio as you commute hither and thither? I don't want to throw a string of suggestions your way, but I can't help but use examples of the different styles of *using* the art form.\n\n**Music that requires Active Listening**\n\nThe goal with these kinds of songs is to take something away from them. Whether that's to learn a story or evoke an emotion they have a purpose that they're either subtle or extremely demanding in communicating. While you can give these songs your full mental attention while performing some menial task it is not recommended. The easiest example of what I'm talking about is the Concept album, or musical. Janelle Monae and her Archandroid series tells a story. Other club-someone-over-the-head simple to attend artists include [The Protomen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqAvvwu0kMU) and to a lesser extent Coheed and Cambria if you check out their comics.\n\n[Songs that are poems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zLfCnGVeL4) fall into this category as well. If you enjoy poetry maybe you'd like slam poetry, something (hear me out) [artistic rappers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAbbnuVo7e4) do extremely well.\n\nAnother type of music that requires Active attention is music for music's sake, strictly artistic. It sounds like this isn't something you'll be big on so I'll gloss over it. [Classical has a tendency to fall into this category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvFH_6DNRCY) due to the emotional suggestion its simple yet complex construction can create.\n\n[This kind of music, the nebulus, the ambient, the evocative, can get... weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQcE4_7-X78) (If you jump to about 7:30 You'll find my favorite progression. The escalation at around 9:20 sends chills down my spine every time).\n\n**Music that requires Passive Listening**\n\nHere's the kind of music I think you're not enjoying. The stuff on the radio, the familiar and/or common. Metallica (based on another comment) is awesome driving music for some because you don't need to know the words to get pumped.\n\nYou don't need to pay attention to it to enjoy it. It's music that can safely be used to seek abnegation (the dulling of thought that in the extreme borders on meditation or even inexistence). This is background music. That doesn't mean it's not awesome in its own right (for many folks) but it doesn't require attention and often serves to supplement it in some way. [This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-2-jD-42Q) for example is my go to background music for showers, because I've associated it in the past with peace of mind, and late night excursions into the locker room to have the place all to myself (I went to a military school with communal showers so this was a rare treat). It's repetitive, and in the shower I can't hear the words, but the echoing piano and the dull rhythm of Shing02's voice soothed me, and made me feel less alone tucked away in the steel-shod bowels of a military institution.\n\nAnyway, that last bit was personal, but I hope I've explained my view concisely. There's plenty of overlap between both types of approaches to music in general, so it's not a restriction. It's merely an observation on *how* folks listen. Perhaps you're not a fan of music because you're not finding the way you might want to listen to it. I recommend looking for more songs that require active attention if you're really interested in changing your view. (Here comes the Cheeeesiest ending I've ver posted:) [Otherwise...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0AKJMGxwpE)",
    "rejected": "Let me start with a quote from Sebastian Faulk's *Birdsong*:\n\n&gt;\"The function of music is to liberate in the soul those feelings which normally we keep locked up in the heart.\"\n\nAnd now to my view...\n\nI imagine if anyone else replies to this they might address the artistic qualities of music, but I'm not going to. Mainly because I don't have any experience or intelligence in that area. I don't know keys or notes, I can't play an instrument, and my singing sounds like foxes having sex. However what I can do is hear. And I can also think and feel. And so that is what I'm going to address: the emotional and visceral response to music.\n\nBefore I begin, however, I want to make something clear: I like all kind of music. Though blues, soul, country, and post-rock would be my favourite genres, my iPod has a list of artists ranging from Pavarotti to Sigur Rós, Drake to Michael Bolton, Keith Whitley to Etta James, Katy Perry to Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman. What I'm trying to say here is not that I have an eclectic taste, but rather a taste dictated by my ears and heart. I'm a mid-twenties guy and if I want to listen to Taylor Swift I'm going to fucking listen to her!\n\nSo where am I going with all this, you might ask. Well, I'm going straight to your \"exception\":\n\n&gt;There is one exception to the rule. If I have associated a piece of music to an emotion for example through a film that I really enjoyed it can bring me back memories from the movie. But if I hadn't seen the movie then the music would do nothing to me.\n\nIf you hadn't included this caveat to your post, I would have thought that you truly didn't like music. But you do! You like music that you associate with an \"emotion\". However, the problem is that in your head you've created the emotional connection between the music and the film. So when you're listening to the music you're reminded of the film, the characters, and the music's connectedness with the cinematic situation. This, I feel, is the issue, because music is about an emotional connection to yourself, to your past, to your history and future, to the people you have met and loved and lost, and the adventures and times you have lived through.\n\nI bet if you spoke to your music-loving friends and asked them if they had any songs that can evoke an emotional response due to its significance with a person or past event or period of their lives, they'd all be able to give you a playlist full of songs. They'd be able to do this because music is something that connects us to our past and present feelings. And those feelings don't have to be love or relationship-related, they just have to exist.\n\nCan I ask how old you are? I imagine you're young, maybe around twenty or younger, probably in high school or early-college. (I'm only making this assumption because I don't know many people post-college who force people to listen to music.) My guess is that you do like music but you think you don't. Maybe because you just haven't made that emotional connection yet, or maybe because your primary experience is being forced to listen to it. (Please excuse my presumptuousness in this regard.)\n\nI would urge you to listen to more music. And not just when you're sitting down doing nothing as that doesn't work for you. And not with your friends. If you have to force yourself to listen to music of course you're going to hate it! Instead, listen to music when you're doing something. Going for a drive to nowhere? Listen to music. Going for a run? Listen to music. Getting ready to go out? Listen to music. Doing the gardening? Listen to music. Washing up? Listen to music. Fuck, just listen to music. And if you hate it, turn it off. Find a new artist. Find a new song. And when you're killing time doing something, try listening again. I guarantee you will eventually find a genre, artist, band, or song you love. And not just because it was in a movie.\n\nAnyway, to finish up I just want to say my favourite band is Sigur Rós. They're Icelandic post-rock. They're well known, so your friends might have already told you about them. The thing is, I speak English. I don't speak Icelandic. So I don't understand the lyrics to their songs. In fact, some of their song lyrics are actually gibberish. But they're my favourite band. And the reason for that is because even though I don't understand what they're saying in their songs, I can *feel* what they're saying. I can feel the emotion. I can feel the energy. I can feel the life of the song. I can feel the love and hate and hope. I feel the music. In the end, I listen to music because it helps me to listen to myself.\n\nI probably haven't changed your view, but just wanted to explain what music means to me. A person who has absolutely no musical talent, just ears and a heart. Like most animals and people on this planet.\n\nP.s. You should totally check out Sigur Rós. [Here's one of my favourites. It's called \"Fljótavík\".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHnP_NNv_3A). (Sorry, I honestly couldn't resist offering a suggestion.)"

    "chosen": "1) There weren't terribly many bombings before 9/11, either. The primary example was the Oklahoma City Bombing, which was a lot like the Boston Bombing. Why? Because the people with unfriendly attitudes are generally thousands of miles away. It's hard to go thousands of miles and THEN try to blow something you've never seen before up. Those other countries that have a lot of bombings generally have their hostile populations *right there*, which makes the whole thing so much easier.\n\n**Terrorism requires organization, organization doesn't travel well, therefore there should be very few foreign terror threats.**\n\n2) Yes, the average home contains everything required to make bombs. The pressure cooker bomb used at the Boston Marathon was made entirely off the shelf. The Oklahoma City bombs was powered fertilizers.\n\nThe knowledge and even plans for bomb making are available in magazines, on the internet, and in survival guides.\n\n**Bomb making materials are common. The knowledge is available. People generally don't want to make bombs, so they don't.**\n\nWhat all of this comes down to is that current surveillance systems are far too big for the objectives. Bombings were never commonplace. The most likely group to actually bomb us isn't Al Qaeda or any foreign threat, but rather domestic extremists. It generally isn't in the interest of domestic extremists to bomb anyone, because it doesn't suit their goals. Those who do want to cause America harm generally has lower hanging fruit that doesn't involve going through customs, IE military bases and embassies.\n\nI don't see why anyone should be spied on through a program that doesn't have any means of zeroing in on a serious threat. If a foreign group is a threat then they can collect data on that group. If a local group is a threat then they can collect data on that group. If they don't feel as though a group is a threat, then how does having data they aren't even looking at going to let them prevent an attack?",

Post 9/11 the U.S. was involved in two costly, intractable wars that put an influx of U.S. forces directly in the region many of these groups were operating in. Why bother financing an expensive operation likely to get shutdown before the cells even make it into the US when you can strap a $30 bomb to Akmed and tell him to walk up to a checkpoint. \n\n&gt; 2) Is it easy for somebody to acquire bomb making materials? If not I would say it is because of the efforts of the government. If the answer is \"yes\" then why arent we seeing more bombings?\n\nGetting cells into the US is difficult post 9/11. The states also monitor purchases that can be used to create bombs easily. If you walk into a store out of the blue and even manage to walkout with trucks worth of fertilizer, you are going to have the police question you. \n\nThat said if one is dedicated they could still make a bomb fairly easily. The threat of terrorism has been grossly exaggerated in the US and it doesn't represent a systemic risk to the country. \n\n"

WWE decided that no one in their current (full-time) stable was worth that kind of bump. They have some people who fans will turn out to see in PPVs whether they'd recently ended the Undertaker's streak or not. Instead, this was simply looked at as a business deal... where could this result get the most bang for their buck.

[Undertaker handpicked Lesner](http://www.cagesideseats.com/2014/4/7/5591754/undertaker-handpicked-brock-lesnar-to-end-the-streak-at-wrestlemania-30). He knows his career is waning. He hasn't been much of a full-timer himself recently. (And that's no knock.. he's already long since put in the work, so he's earned it.) When it came time for him to pick someone to end his streak, he decided that a legitimate fighter, with the cache of having won the MMA World Championship previously in his career, was the man he wanted to go out to.",

If the gimmick doesn't work, or they get injured, or (as has been more common in the PG era) get a little popular and split for Hollywood, then you wasted the streak for nothing.\n\n**Putting it on a current \"main-eventer\"**: You still run the risk of injury (e.g. Edge), and you pretty much lock them in as a perma-heel. The only ones who could've handled that convincingly are the \"fan-favorites\" who are so over, they transcend heel/face casting, and at the time, there were only two people who fit that bill: CM Punk, *and The Undertaker*.\n\n**Putting it on a big name**: This is what they actually did, put it on a \"name\", as a one off, huge match. It gives Taker an exit if he can't compete for a year or so (I'm sure he'll have at least one more WM match), gives you built in heat on whoever you put it on (i.e. years from now Brock: \"Oh yeah, remember that time I broke the streak), and sets up a great \"white knight\" feud with someone (\"you broke the streak, now I'm gonna break you\", etc). \n\nWhile I don't like the fact that they used Brock, I have no problem with them doing it the way they did. Personally, I'd have loved to see Kane take the streak if they were going to give it to a part-timer. \n\nMy \"dream match\" would've been having ~~Husky Harris~~ Bray Wyatt take it, helping to put over the \"Undertaker: The Next Generation\" gimmick he's got going on.

    "prompt": "I think the United States should be a direct democracy. CMV",
    "chosen": "I can think of three reasons why direct democracy is not preferable:\n\nThe unfortunate main answer is that we would still find ways to skew power to the wealthy or ambitious in a direct democracy. Laws are often very lengthy and are written by trained experts because if they are even a little ambiguous it creates problems with people interpreting them differently. Who would write the potential laws that people vote on? You also need some limits to screen which proposed laws even make it to a vote, and whoever controls that process would wield as much power as any Senator.  Or who arbitrates when the people vote for contradictory things? Say they vote to increase funding for education, healthcare, and the military, but to raise taxes only a little (or even cut them). Who decides where that little bit of extra money actually goes? Having runoff elections every time would be a long and slow process. There would be a hundred such hurdles before a proposed bill becomes law that would allow representative distortion possibly even greater than at present. \n\nA second issue is the complexity of governing. It really is a full time job. Issues that affect many people are often too complex to be understood by those not well versed in the field, and to give many, many uninformed people a vote would cause problems. International trade agreements, details of insurance regulation, funding for a specific medical or scientific project; laws may not need to be thousands of pages long, but do often need to be lengthy and technical. The access to expert opinion is much higher for a Congressperson than for a layperson.  \n\nThe third issue is speed. Direct Democracy performs worse in crises. With elected representatives, there are actually people you can call in the middle of the night when a dozen Americans are kidnapped, or a bomb explodes in an embassy. People who know in advance they are responsible for those kind of decisions and can prepare. It would be much more challenging to get a quick response from a national poll, and as peoples' feelings change in the immediate aftermath of the crises, so too might their desired response. \n\nSo that's why I think Direct Democracy would be no better, and possibly worse, than Representative Democracy. It would not necessarily give more power to the people, it is not an effective way of dealing with complex issues, and it moves too slowly in a crisis.\n\nedit: sentence agreement",

    "prompt": "I don't see what the big deal is with Monsanto, CMV",
    "chosen": "Monsanto is very good at what they do and they are taking advantage of a flawed system, exacerbating the problem (and people lack of understanding... but ill get to this in a little). \n\nIntro: The problem lies in large scale monoculture, it is inherently unsustainable for soil health and, will quickly enough deplete the soil of N, P, or K (and tons of phytonutrients) as the soil depletes, the plants to be sustained by artificial means, fertilizer to grow, and pesticides to prevent them from being eaten. Monsanto, through round up and BT ready crops, allow this cycle to continue, further destroying the earth soil.\n\nSO: Monsanto allows large amounts of genetically modified food to be grown for cheap (because labor drops to nothing ,when it comes to grains especially). this has allowed GM food take on the vast majority of the food market with limited testing. It is worth noting here how difficult a long term food study would be, consider 60+  years on a population w/a controlled diet. the difficulty of doing this is incredible. \n\nto ansewr than the Q: \n\n\"Do they somehow force agricultors to buy their shit?\" the aswer is no BUT, the soil is so depleted, and would take a few (even if its 1-5) years to build up its health. in which time a famr can easily go into the red. and so the farmers have become DEPENDENT on their seeds and fertilizer which perpetuates the problem of needing Monsanto\n\nso to begin with, what I have stated above is unknown to most people, and food is grown for everyone. Furthermore, most people don't have a damn idea about how the food has ended up on their table, and Monsanto preys upon this. or rather other large food companies do, partner with Monsanto. Unilever etc wants large amounts of cheep modifiable grain (mind this grain &amp; corn is govt subsidized), this allows for big profit margins, and creates the impression that organic (non-Monsanto) food is unfairly expensive, when really non-organics are subsidized. anyway, back to the point, the majority of people are supporting, indirectly, Monsanto, and while farmer bob can choose a different set of seeds, that's only a tiny percentage . keep in mind farms are now BIG and require less labor, so peoples anger at Monsanto is that they are cornering the seed market and unless people wise up to it they will be in control of way to much of the food supply. \n\nwhich brings me to the next point,especially when Monsanto is playing with seeds that are unable to give functional offspring, these have, once again unknown consequences for the future (ie cross breeding with unmodified seeds).\n\nand that is why \"fuck monsanto.\"",

When you buy livestock and raise it, the person they purchased from does not get royalties for the calves. With patent law though you cannot do anything with those calves without paying licensing. Although if that is part of their contracts, then i see nothing wrong.\n\n The other aspect is how hard breeding is to control in. If Monsanto crops are planted near to a non Monsanto field, cross contamination can and inevitably will happen. It makes it harder than for farmers to plant non-gmo plants if that is there desire, and Mansanto has sued farmers for replanting fields found to have their genes even by accident.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Schmeiser"

    "prompt": "Homeless people are homeless because they don't try not to be.",
    "chosen": "I have been homeless three times now -- and I assure you that *almost nobody* is homeless by choice.\n\nIt's all about resource management.\n\nYou see, each homeless person realized one day that he was unable to come up with the money needed for everything.  Each story is different but the thing most of those stories have in common is the realization that you can live in a car but you can't drive an apartment.\n\nSo the first stage of homelessness is typically couch surfing with friends or family.  But for those who cant, for whatever reason, do that -- well they end up living out of their cars.  And even the couch surfers generally end up at Camp Toyota after a short period of time anyway.\n\nThey're homeless though they often still have jobs.\n\nYou might not even realize they're homeless.  In fact, I dare say you know at least one homeless person and don't have the slightest clue they're homeless.\n\nBut living out of your car is difficult.  You have to hide the fact that you're living in your car because it is not generally allowed.  That means that you have to go to sleep very late each night.  It also means you have to spend a significant amount of time finding somewhere to use the bathroom and to shower.  Oh yeah, and you don't get very restful sleep in your car.\n\nSo even if you have a job to begin with, you're starting to look a bit haggard after a short period of time.  You haven't slept.  You're struggling to keep yourself presentable but showers are hard to come by.  You don't have a bathroom mirror at your disposal.\n\nAnd by now, your employer is becoming less and less happy with you.\n\nOh sure, you're really trying to hold it together -- but damn, everything is *so* much harder now.  And sometimes it takes months before you lose that job -- but you're going to lose it.  After all, you've been working as well as spending several hours per day just trying to find somewhere to shit.\n\nAnd *everything* costs far more when you're homeless.  You can't cook so every meal is at a restaurant.  You might, as I did, move into a hotel.  But that eats up pretty much your whole paycheck (I did this for years).\n\nAnd at this point, absolutely anything that goes wrong is catastrophic.\n\nThe day you lose your job you're pretty much hosed.\n\nNow you don't have the means to do laundry.  Or shower.  So you have a very short window in which you might pick up another job.  If you miss that window you're not likely to bounce back without anybody's help.\n\nBut you don't know that yet.\n\nYou're still hopeful and you keep trying.\n\nBut eventually you figure out that it's pretty easy to get enough to get by:  dollar menu items, a pack of cigarettes, maybe a bottle of beer.  Yeah, the cigarettes and beer may seem wasteful to somebody with somewhere to sleep -- but it's not like you had a choice between having a home and smoking. You had a choice between a value meal and a pack of cigarettes and two McDoubles.\n\nAnd heaven forbid someone jacks your ID.\n\nIf you find yourself without an ID, the world just got very narrow for you.  You can't even do day labor -- which btw, is how many homeless people get by. They're working, but not every day because it's pointless to work every day on three hours of uneasy sleep at Camp Toyota.\n\nAnd somewhere around this time your car insurance lapses.\n\nSo now your home (your car) is in constant jeopardy.  The first time you get pulled over, your home is history.  Oh sure, they'll let you go to the impound yard to collect your belongings -- but you're leaving on foot.\n\nWith everything you own on your back.\n\nHow open are potential employers to hiring you?  Precisely equal to the average person's willingness to help you out with cash:  at nearly zero.\n\nOnce you've reached the point that people can tell you're homeless, ain't nobody giving you a job.  Well, maybe.  But it's not likely. \n\nWhen you see someone who has been reduced to the point of begging you're not looking at someone who doesn't want to work, have a home, clothes, fresh food, and someone to love.  You're seeing someone who has so many roadblocks standing before him that for right now if he can get a sandwich and a bottle of beer or coca cola, he can relax for a few hours.\n\nWhen I have money and a homeless person begs for some of it, I reach in my pocket and grab one bill and immediately hand it over without looking at it.  Sometimes it has been a $100 bill and it has stung a little bit to hand it over.\n\nWhenever they say something like \"I promise I'm going to spend this on food\", I always tell them that it's none of my business what they spend *their* money on.\n\nI can't give them a home, but I can give them a fleeting moment of dignity (the first thing they lost when they started circling the drain).",
    "rejected": "As a disclaimer, I have known a number of homeless people personally in my life. I grew up in a stagnant railroad town where transient homeless people drifted in and out constantly, and I befriended a number of them over the years helping out at my family's store by the train station. \n\nWith most homeless people, it just isn't as simple as giving them some counseling and handing them a job application. You have to understand that your average homeless person didn't just wake up one morning, quit their job, move out of their apartment, and start sleeping in the street. Rather, they typically have faced combination of problems over years and years that led them to where they are. Many of them have serious mental health issues (not the kind of thing that can be fixed by some therapy sessions and a bottle of pills) including severe schizophrenia and PTSD (why you see so many homeless veterans). Many of them have serious issues with substance abuse including everything from alcoholism to meth or heroin addiction. Many of them come from a history of being abused and neglected as children. Most of them probably have some combination of all of the above.\n\nAs such, helping a homeless person dig their way out of a hole dug by a lifetime of very serious problems is almost never as simple as telling them to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and get a job. Helping them off the streets and onto a better life is possible for many of them, but it takes a careful and persistent approach. For example, I have a friend who used to be a social worker in Utah, and she explained to me a very successful program for homeless people in which the state essentially just gives them apartments. At first glance, it seems as though it wouldn't be very effective, but it has actually had huge success in reducing homelessness in the state. The reason for this, according to my friend, is that someone can't fail out of the program. If you take a homeless person and give them ultimatums like \"stay clean from drugs and alcohol\" or \"hold down this job for a month\", they are almost guaranteed to mess up and will be kicked back to the streets after a week. However, if you work with them and give them the opportunity to make mistakes and correct them, over time you can help a lot of them find their way back into society."

    "prompt": "I believe there is no moral framework in which it is permissible to eat meat but not to have sex with animals.",
    "chosen": "Well there's nothing wrong with the act of eating meat itself. What's typically thought to be wrong about meat-eating is the suffering inflicted upon animals as part of industrial farming. If we were to reform our practices around meat-eating, however, and do away with these objectionable conditions, it's possible to to satisfy your first condition, to hold that eating meat is permissible.\n\nFor the second, we just need to hold, quite reasonably, that animals have rights against being harmed and that non-consensual sex is a harm. Both of these are pretty straightforward given how we view the torture of animals and rape.\n\nI suppose what puzzles you is the apparent tension between saying \"it's OK to kill an animal and eat it\" and \"but animals have rights against being harmed.\" This tension can be resolved if death turns out not to be a harm for the one who dies. Now this is actually a fairly tenable view. Consider some paradigmatic cases of harm: you break your leg, you're robbed, or you're psychologically abused. Something every case of harm seems to have in common is that the harm involves a comparison your state of being before and after the harming event. So when you break your leg you're worse off than you were before breaking your leg in virtue of the pain and hindered motion that you experience. If you're robbed you're worse off than you were before the robbing in virtue of being deprived of whatever was stolen. If you're psychologically abused, then you're worse off in virtue of the change in your mental well-being. So harm involves a comparison between how you were before the harming event and how you were after it. Given this comment element it's reasonable to define harm in comperative terms. So something like \"S is harmed by event X if and only if S is made worse off than they were with X having happened.\"\n\nNow when we try to conceive of death as a harm we run into a problem. Namely, there is no \"you after death\" to compare to. So before death you were x, y, and z, but after death you are non-existent. Since there's nothing to compare to, we can't count death as a harm on the comparative account that I gave above. Perhaps there's some other way to make sense of death as a harm for the one who has died or perhaps death is only bad for people who cared about the deceased and have had their own interests frustrated by her death. I'm not going to come down on either side of this debate here, but the latter is at least a reasonable approach to take and if it's correct then we can coherently say of animals that it's OK to kill them, but not OK to harm them.\n\nDoes that make sense?",
    "rejected": "Under the moral framework of rational self-interest, objectivism, virtue-value ethics, or Aristotelian ethics eating meat of animals is good because it gives us sustenance, and the *means* are justified as we have rights over beings that don't have the potential for free will or rational thought. Beastiality (as with rape or sex with a tree) is bad because it is an act that is self destructive i.e. self demeaning to the perpetrator (an act of destroying your own integrity). \n\nUnder this system, it's moral or immoral depending on the effect on the actor/eater/fornicator - rather than the effect on the actee/eaten/fornicated.\n\n"

Here are some facts from the [World Wildlife Fund](http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/biodiversity/biodiversity/): \n\n* The rapid loss of species we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.\n* These experts calculate that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year.\n* If the low estimate of the number of species out there is true - i.e. that there are around 2 million different species on our planet** -  then that means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year.\n* But if the upper estimate of species numbers is true - that there are 100 million different species co-existing with us on our planet - then between 10,000 and 100,000 species are becoming extinct each year.\n\nI have a dilemma; I want to maintain your rosy perspective on human achievement and potential, but I do want to change your view that the future is overwhelmingly positive without *lots and lots of work*. Work that very well may not happen, leaving us with a less hospitable, and irrecoverably less diverse natural world. \n\nA very scary part of all this is that the incredible economy you talked about, often fueled by exploitation and war, is the driver of a huge amount of the activity which creates so many of these problems. But the social side of environmental issues is a whole other can of worms, one that touches on the fact that the vast majority of humanity is not achieving any version of the comfort and security of the most developed nations, and that the global cultural paradigm is not set up for an 'everyone wins' system - exploitation is, at a very deep level, built in. \n\nThere is no evidence that this is in any way driving us towards an enlightened social future in regard to economic justice for most people around the world. Not that there aren't social movements that are exciting, but money and power have a bit of a vice grip on society, and the pyramid scheme has worked out well for those few at the top for a long time. A bigger room at the top of the pyramid is not, in my book, human progress, especially when it is contingent on little paid or unpaid labor at the bottom. Oof, sorry for the social rant. Back to the environment.\n\nIf you want just one small but detailed slice of the biodiversity issue, check out the documentary 'The End of the Line' about overfishing in our oceans. It touches on how in such a \"great\" human civilization may manage to completely devastate our oceans for generations.\n\n**TL;DR**: There isn't much greatness in one species affecting a mass extinction of the scale we are currently seeing. It is so bad, that the current era is being labeled the ['Anthropocene'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene), and is largely characterized by drastic loss in biodiversity - which without us would have increased exponentially. It is hypothesized that we have created the sixth mass extinction of planet earth, and despite international efforts it is only getting worse.\n\n*edit: added TLDR.*\n*edit 2: formatting!*\n",
    "rejected": "3 things.\n\n1) Global Warming. It is the most important issue of our time, and even relatively optimistic models show us blowing past the 2 degree mark that singals the comtinuation of a relatively stable climate. And yet, people and nations are not talking much about it or doomg much about it. At the best, Germany has made great strides in introducing much remewable power into their country lately. However, they have also taken a huge step backwards by ending all nuclear programs, becoming more relient on fossil fuels for intermittant power. Meanwhile, developing nations are spewing out greenhouse gasses s their industries and standard of living rise, and the wealthiest nation on earth can't even convince half its population that global warming is happening. I believe we will make it through this, but at the expense of a large amount of our standard of living, a great deal of the beautiful ecology of this planet, and the lives of the world's poorest.\n\n2) The information age has led to a great amount of connection, yes. And computers are becoming more complex and powerful by the day. However, the most advanced programs are not owned in a common space by all people, but are owned by private corporations, who will use them for profit. As the internet of things grows, you will be endlessly tracked so that the most persuasive advertisements can be made to entice you to part with your money, so that you are forced into a system of drudgery, slavong away at your job, only to be fleeced once again by an advertizing campaign so nuanced that you won't even realize it is happening. As the number of jobs done by machines (owned by the companies) increases, the population of earth divides in two: the unemployed, and the owners of the companies. And as the machines become ever more knowledgable and complex, they dissapear from the public eye into the eather, becoming alongside their owners, gods. Ruling over the peasents of earth. All hail Ronald McDonald, hallowed be his name.\n\n3) As we develop new technology, the potential for an individual to be great increases. If you want to learn or do something, it is easier than ever. However, the fastest advancements come in the form of mindless distractions. It is now easier than ever to not focus on the world around you. We are given access to an ever increasing amount of drivel games, meme jokes, porn, and novel drugs. As technology develops, we will eventually develop virtual reality, where the illusion is so compelling, amusing, enjoyable, and ever so slightly challenging, that we never want to leave. Meanwhile, while we are so distracted, our world falls to shit as voter participation drops to zero."

    "prompt": "Ted Cruz is not a serious candidate, he's just being used by republicans to make the actual candidate seem less extreme",
    "chosen": "I am someone who has personally met and spoken with Ted Cruz on a handful of occasions working up here in DC, starting as far back in 2012 when he was running for the senate seat. I can tell you he genuinely believes in all the things he stands for. What is a calculated persona is \"Senator\" Ted Cruz. By which I mean he plays the room he is in. He is a pretty cunning orator like him or hate him. He is extremely shrewd and knows exactly how to play the jazz of politics. He knows what runs in the headlines. He knows what plays to his base. He punches way outside his weight class and it's paying off.\n\nThink about what he's actually accomplished outside of rhetoric. Outside of his speaking and sabre rattling there really nothing tangible he has to show for. Sure he's introduced bills and made motions on the floor but to what end. Political headlines and thats about it.\n\nHis Obamacare efforts are by large are entirely political theater and is not seriously doing any of the back channel to work to change any of the regulations he opposes. He knows this. And yet when people think of \"anti-obamacare\" crusaders Ted Cruz is the first name that pops into their heads.\n\nHe continually makes click-bait level soliloquies that ultimately amount to a youtube highlight reel of bashing all the \"evil all star team\" of democrats and bureaucrats. It helps him in two ways. By making it look like he's busy fighting hard for republicans, it allows most americans who barely follow any legislative matters to believe he is the hardest working junior senator in this town. The second boon is he get's to be demonized by the left which raises his profile even higher.\n\nHe has rebranded his ideas twice in 3 years by changing absolutely nothing in his positions. When he was running he championed himself as a liberty first Tea Party Republican cut from Ron Paul's ilk. (A political point many around the Paul and liberty wing didn't believe to be genuine). He talked about freeing americans from tyranny and oppression from federal over reach, all while quoting Jefferson, Madison, and Patrick Henry. It won huge dividends. In that last 12 months he has championed himself a fighter for those conservative values that under constant attack from both the government as well as left extremists seeking to erode traditional values. But what has he changed in his policy positions? Nothing. People just bought his stump speeches right up.\n\nHe is constantly underestimated. Just ask the guy who spent 20 million too little too late trying beat him while Ted only spent 7 million. That almost never happens in todays elections. Remember Barack Obama buzz level in 2004-2007. Outside of that amazing DNC speech he really went under the radar till 2007 when he burst onto the scene. They both are in a similar meteoric rise but taking completely different approaches. Ted Cruz went from an absolute nobody in politics to arguably the most recognizable Republican faces in 2015 and he did through a crazy mix Machiavellian planning and Frank Underwood jazz. I don't know how many times people are going to be caught with their pants down underestimating Ted Cruz before they wise up.\n\nDoes he really believe in all his policies and positions? Absolutely. But he's not here to be a statesmen and to legislate. He's here to advance his agenda. He's not here to do what statesmen do; make concessions and build coalitions. He's wants to do whatever it takes to get his ideas and his face to the next level, and if you look at what he's done he makes Underwood look like schoolboy in the political arena. That should scare everybody. Sure he's a long shot by far, but he's been in this spot before and it's kind of his political M.O.\n\nTl;dr: Ted Cruz is a serious candidate. He believes in what he says, but he knows how to say it to get you to notice. It scares the republican party. It fires up the base. His chances are quite slim, but he has been manipulating the media to his advantage and it's working. Whether that streak can stand on a national stage, we will have to wait and see.\n\n\nCaveat: I don't like Ted Cruz. I think he's the archetype of a fake smile in a nice suit and a wolf and sheep's clothing. But he's not stupid, he's incredibly smart. But fuck him he's a politician and if that doesn't already make him a dick he stands for some real bullshit.",

People used to break party lines more and within parties people would run against each other more. This gradually shifted to Democrat or Republican. The people don't matter, only the party.\n\nAs this occurred states started to become Democrat or Republican states. It didn't matter if you were the best candidate, if you were a Republican you didn't try to win California because it just wouldn't happen. A democrat wouldn't try to win in Texas, etc. It just wasn't an efficient allocation of campaign resources to even bother in X-party strong holds.\n\nThus the emergence of the swing state. The small handful of states that might actually change which party they supported. The small handful of states that had to actually be won to win the elections. If your state is not a swing state your vote doesn't matter to a presidential candidate. Its that simple.\n\nSo politicians figured out that you campaign hard in swing states, do a bit of good will appearance in your parties states, and completely avoid the other parties states.\n\nEventually, and this finally brings things full circle, there was a marketing and advertising revolution taking place in America. Some political campaigns decided to apply these concepts to getting votes.\n\nEnter the voter focus group. You've probably heard of product focus groups. You identify the market for a product, get a bunch of people from that market in a room, and show them your product while getting a bunch of feedback from them about it.\n\nThis exact same thing is done in swing states where identified \"unsure\" voters are brought into focus groups by political campaigns. They ask them questions about what they want in a candidate, etc.\n\nThose are the talking points you'll see on TV. Its not that Ted Cruz is crazy or not a serious candidate. Its that he is representing the views of a tiny, tiny fraction of the country. The swing voters in swing counties in swing states that actually get to elect the President. Those views are not those of Republicans or Ted Cruz. They're the views of those swing voters being parroted back to them to ensure they put a check next to the R on the ballot and swing the other hundreds of millions of votes in that direction.\n\ntl;dr Our entire voting system is broken, outdated, and being gamed. A handful of typically uneducated working class people are determining who the President will be and what they'll be focused on from the public perspective."

Try Gary Cox's [How to be an Existentialist](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Existentialist-Making-Excuses/dp/1441139877) for an easy intro into the philosophy Rand most obviously borrows from (consciously or not). Then look up Michael Huemer and [Ethical Intuitionism](http://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Intuitionism-Michael-Huemer/dp/0230573746/): he argues that (a) contrary to popular opinion, most people actually share the same set of moral principles (morality is *kind of* objective), and (b) we should be prepared to act against those principles when there are strong utilitarian arguments in favour of doing so (eg, telling lies in order to save lives) - also see David Friedman's [Machinery of Freedom](http://daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf), where he makes a strong case for the same. These are arguments that Rand never really considered in her writing.\n\nFinally, the best cure I found for bad philosophy was to take other subjects. Take economics: you learn how to trade off competing utilitarian arguments against your own morals, and you get a shedload of solid consequentialist evidence for the free market system. If you want to expose yourself to the other side of the political spectrum, development and labour econ are full of strong (and view-changing) arguments for state-intervention. And if you really want to know the nature of objective reality, take a course in statistics and read Bryan Greene's [Elegant Universe](http://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Universe-Superstrings-Dimensions-Ultimate/dp/0375708111/) - objectivity is a tricky concept, and arguably John Galt should have known better.\n\nDo these and then come back to Ayn Rand. You'll see that she was a strong intellectual, but her philosophical framework is a dud and extremely limiting if you're trying to form a world-view. There is a LOT of information in the world which can't be derived from her starting premises, and you'd be quite a bit happier for exploring some of it.",

Since reality is what we each create in our own individual heads, based off our own individual brains, you could have one best band of all time for every individual in the world. You can't guarantee that everyone experiences the same thing the same way.\n\n There's no objective standard for such a concept such as best band, because its impossible. \"Best\" is a subjective word because there are ton of ways to measure best: Best pitch, best market success, etc. You can't objectively prove a band is the best the way you can prove something is the cheapest. Something being the cheapest is based off a singular measurement that involves no input from a brain. But if you try to whittle down \"best band\" to a singular measurement that involves no input from your brain you've already failed. Because you've decided that that's the measurement that determines what's \"best\" you made a subjective judgement. And while you may be able to come up with a logical argument for why its a good measurement, I can come up with an equally valid argument for another measurement."

    "prompt": "Being the carrier of a genetic defect, i don't think i should have a second children.",
    "chosen": "First of all, if you had a second child with galactosemia, he or she almost certainly wouldn't have the same near-death experience and resulting developmental delays as your first child because you would know not to give breast milk or lactose-containing formula before the results of the test came back. To the best of my knowledge, galactose does not cross the placenta.\n\nSecondly, I think the most wise thing to do would be to have you and your wife sit down with a professional genetic counselor before getting pregnant again. If you are both comfortable with the idea of abortion, you might be able to do some testing of the fetus early in the pregnancy to determine whether it is homozygous for the GALT mutation. Odds are, it won't be -- but if it is, you could just terminate and try again.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that it might be lonely for the child you already have to grow up as the \"sick\" kid. It can be really psychologically traumatizing to always be that kid who's different. So even if you had a second kid with galactosemia, it might be a positive thing for the two of them to have one another. They can watch out for each other, come up with recipes together, and really \"get\" each other in a way that not many other people could. It could be a positive thing for your family.\n\nAlso... it's funny that you seem to think the worst consequence of this disease on a girl would be ovarian damage that might preclude her from having biological children, yet that's what you would be forcing on your wife. At least if you had a daughter with galactosemia, you could give her the heads up from childhood that carrying her own children would never be in the cards for her. She would be able to make life choices using that knowledge. Your wife, on the other hand, has been dreaming of having multiple babies her entire life. If someone told me that I couldn't have more than one baby, I would be crushed (*especially* if the first child was ill or a special-needs child).\n\n**TL;DR** I think that you guys can absolutely give pregnancy another shot if it's still something your wife wants -- but meeting with a genetic counselor before trying is crucial.",

Given the 75% chance of the child being disease-free, you probably would even need to get that abortion.\n"

    "prompt": "I don't hear any musical quality in the screaming vocals found in many genres of metal music. CMV",
    "chosen": "I'm not sure if this has been mentioned, but there's a specific reason why vocals in extreme metal are growled. A vast number, I would claim an overwhelming majority of extreme metal bands are fronted by guitarists, and as a result the music is very guitar heavy. If you listen closely to the verse of an extreme metal song, a melody typically exists. Where it is traditionally carried by the vocalist, it is instead carried by the guitars. If the vocalist were to sing with a melodic style it would act as a counterpoint (in a bad way) and clash with the rest of the music. They choose the non-melodic approach of growling in order to preserve and draw attention to the guitar parts, as well as the rest of the band\n\nThis also serves another purpose. By removing the melodic aspect from singing, it allows the vocalist, and thus the listener, to focus on one main aspect - the delivery of the lyrics. Lyrics are very important to heavy metal music and growled vocals force the listener to really focus and get in tune with the music in order to truly understand its message. In pop music, the vocal melody is a main selling point because it overshadows the rest of the music, as well as the lyrics. You can think of the music as accompanying the vocals, which are layered on top of everything else. Growled vocals move along with the music, and bring the attention of the listener to the music as a whole.\n\nAnother point is that good growling is the result of practice and not innate talent. Everyone can learn to growl but it takes a lot of time and effort to be any good at it. Some extreme metal vocalists are talented singers but a good number of them, being guitarists by trade, are not. In lieu of having a band member that just sings, these frontmen, who may also be the primary lyricist, prefer to do the singing themselves.",
    "rejected": "A couple of things you should consider.  Hopefully, they are succinct enough to be helpful.\n\n1) You will come to 'musically' appreciate screaming vocals so long as you first appreciate the music that contains them.\n\nPersonal experience here, but I couldn't bear screaming vocals when I started listening to heavy music.  However, I found Opeth's Still Life so incredibly beautiful, that I had to keep listening.  My fascination with the melodic and story telling aspects of the album compelled me.  With time, I found Akerfedlt''s vocal performance as spectacular as the other musical components that drew me in.  Now, years and many albums later, I can appreciate metal vocals in any context or simply on their own.\n\nThis is to say, if you love the music, you will learn to see the beauty and skill in the vocal performances that you are familiar with.  Then, with time, you can build a universal appreciation for metal vocals with that familiarity.\n\nThe corollary to this point is: don't force it.  If Cannibal Corpse simply doesn't do it for you, don't worry about trying to appreciate the vocals until you have more experience with screaming.\n\n\n2) Consider metal vocals as the only tool capable of conveying the extreme emotional content often contained in metal music.\n\nScreaming and growling are physiologically potent forms of communication.  Like a crying baby, we are programmed to have strong emotional responses to such sounds.  Metal vocals use this to capture the emotions that inspired the music!  (I find this cool in itself.)\n\nConsider [Motion](http://music.basickrecords.com/album/tectonics).  The vocals are gut-wrenching in their emotional appeal.  This could not be accomplished with clean vocals, nor without a significant amount of talent.\n\nA super important perspective arises out of this: In an argument, if an emotional appeal is made, the responding party must be empathic to the speaker in order for the appeal to be effective.  Metal vocals are no different.  The listener must be responsive to the full emotional content of the performance for the performance to be received well and appreciated.  Most people are not willing to subject themselves to such emotional content, so screaming vocals will never be effective or understood.  This is absolutely fine.  I don't expect it of anyone.  If you find yourself having trouble appreciating some generic metalcore song about suicide, then its possible you don't really want to truly engage the subject.  (Which, again, is totally fine.  I usually find such songs not worth the investment.)\n\nHowever, if you really want to understand and appreciate such vocals, even from a musical perspective, you'd better be willing to invest yourself emotionally in them.  I cannot stress how critical this is.  You have to open yourself to a full range of emotional experience, including suffering, mourning, rage, etc.  It's not easy, which is why it took me years to be able to listen to deathcore.  It may be advisable to start off easier, but once you are capable of this, you'll find some incredibly powerful experiences through metal, which is the whole point.\n\n\n3) There is a lot of skill and character involved in screaming.\n\na) Simply the training and conditioning necessary for using your voice in that way with out damaging yourself is quite impressive.\n\nb) Not all performances are equal.  There are good and bad.  Most people argue that metal can get away with bad ones simply because they can be considered rough or edgy.  But this is a poor argument because let me tell you, bad screaming is really fucking bad.  Really.  However, you will find lots of generic, monotonous vocalists in metal.  Of course, these should be recognized and avoided.  Good vocalists will be powerful and dynamic, often capable of using inflection to activate their voices in a variety of different ways successfully.\n\nc) Pitch control is just as important as it is in clean vocals.  Depending on the technique, screaming typically involves a fundamental frequency that can be sung in a tonally pure manner (cleanly).  This means, a talented vocalist can seamlessly transition from a clean note to a scream without changing pitch.  (See below for example.)  This also means that screaming is subject to the same pitch scrutiny that a conventional vocalist is.  Metal vocalists also have to hit the right notes with the right inflection, but the notes they hit are often dissonant.\n\nTake [Eric Kalsbeek](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaEoBMJ0Xy8).  Pay careful attention to the pitch of each scream and how it incorporates with the rest of the song as well as the incredible richness and texture of his voice.  And at 3:25, prepare for a spectacular clean to scream transition.\n\nd) Asians are not all smart.  Conservatives are not all racist.  Metal vocalists do not all sound the same.  If a vocalist takes the time to develop his voice, it will be distinct from other's.  The more experience you have with screaming, the more you will agree with this.  One can learn to recognize that a vocalist has a unique sound and character.\n\n\n4) They print lyrics for a reason.\n\nMetal lyrics are often indecipherable.  That's just the truth.  You will get slightly better at understanding with time, but never very good.  However, flip open the lyric book (you bought the cd, right?) and you will find that they really are speaking a language you understand, its just not quite as obvious.  Is this an obstacle to the music itself? Sure, but since when has metal been easy to listen to?  If you invest the time to fully explore the lyrics of a good metal album, I can guarantee that you will get more out of it."

    "prompt": "I believe that homosexuality and Christianity are incompatible. CMV.",
    "chosen": "I don't think it's possible to be a true Christian if that means not breaking the laws of Christianity. The whole point of Christianity is that no one is able to fulfil the law, because we're all sinful. But it doesn't matter in terms of a Christian's salvation; Jesus died to take the punishment for sin so any person who repents and believes in that is saved, and thus sinless in God's eyes. Sure, Christians try not to sin because sin is against God's will and God knows what's best for us, and we want to please him, but at the end of the day all Christians sin because Christians are human.\n\nSin is not incompatible with Christianity, it's why we need it. Homosexual acts are a sin according to the Bible, but no more so than any other sin, and Christians are [told not to judge others for being a worse sinner that themselves.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207:1-3&amp;version=NIV)\n\nIn my opinion, the issue with being a Christian and a homosexual isn't that it's a sin, it's that it's a conscious sin. To be a Christian and be in a homosexual relationship is to wake up every morning and decide to sin that day by continuing that relationship, rather than accidentally find yourself lying or bitching or whatever, it's premeditated.\n\nBut it's not my place, or your place to judge. Christianity, and any religion is about an individual's relationship with their God. If you're a homosexual Christian and are happy with that decision and feel God is too, then I'm in no place to say anything at all.\n\nDisclaimer: Am a Christian, not homosexual but going through a similar issue.",
    "rejected": "It seems like you have a tenuous grasp of Christianity as practiced by actual Christians. Here are my objections over your post:\n\n1. Christians who are against homosexuality don't hate homosexuals per se; they hate homosexual acts (ie hate the sin, no the sinner). Even among rabid homophobic sects and denominations, celibate/virgin homosexuals are often compared with kleptomaniacs who resist the urge to steal. In other words, they are lauded for resisting their ungodly urges. So already, a homosexual Christian isn't incompatible. They just have to be celibate.\n\n2. On a more theological level, everyone is supposed to be have sinned in the eyes of God. Everyone falls short in the eyes of God. And depending on the denomination, the \"everyone falling short\" part technically condemns everyone to hell. You're going to Hell for being gay, and you're going to Hell for being an asshole to people, and you're going to Hell for drinking too much, etc. That's basically the whole point of Jesus's crucifixion as espoused by Christians. His death is supposed to wash away the presence of sin or otherwise give Christian a fighting chance to enter Heaven. This is also why evangelicalism is a huge deal for Christians because the whole \"Jesus washing away your Hell damning sins\" only works if you actually believe in Jesus. Homosexual acts would just be another form of sin.\n\n3. Your edit of \"the laws of Christianity\" doesn't really make sense. There isn't a agreed upon \"law of Christianity.\" Christians don't agree with the version of Bible to use (KJV vs NIV). Depending on the denomination, there's sections of the Bible that gets replaced (The Catholic Bible has sections that's not found in the Protestant Bible and vice versa). And what about Mormons? They use the Old Testament and New Testament like most Christian denominations, but they also use an additional book called the Book of Mormon. So, does that mean they aren't Christian because they use an additional book?\n\n4. Another objection I have with your post is that religion isn't just \"stuff that we have to follow because it's written in this holy book.\" This is a fair point to mistaken as Protestants tend to focus on the Bible over other things like tradition, and most American Christians are Protestants, which means most American non-Christians are mostly exposed to Protestant Christianity (I'm assuming you're American). But this isn't necessarily true for all Christian denominations. Catholics stress tradition as well as the Bible. That's why Catholics have all these holidays celebrating saints and why Catholics venerate saints even though saints aren't referenced in the Bible at all. Religion exists among illiterate tribes of people, so a canon isn't a necessary condition for a religion. So, what are the traditions of the various Christian denominations? Well, that depends on the denomination. And not all of them will condemn homosexuals (Quakers, Presbyterians, etc)."

    "chosen": "&gt; edit: to clarify, I'm not talking about Java here - I've never used it, and I think it is vilified as much as VS.\n\nQuite true -- more so, in some circles. But the Java stack is now entirely open source, including the best IDEs, so there's that.\n\n&gt; I think all these new languages are hype and most of you don't even know what intelli-sense is.\n\nFirst, define \"new\". Javascript was new in 1995.\n\nBut if you know those languages well, you know that many of their advantages are derived from exactly the sort of choices which make tooling difficult. You mention Rails -- well, Ruby has strong-but-dynamic typing. Dynamic typing means an IDE can only do very limited analysis on your objects -- something like IntelliSense would be impossible.\n\nThe tradeoff is, you don't have to define a huge hierarchy of classes, or even types. You get testability and mockability for free.\n\nAnd best of all, you get a REPL. The best of these gives you the equivalent of IntelliSense in tab-completion.\n\n&gt; It's like going back 20 years. ..Well, at least 15 - at least we had debug, edit, and continue back then.\n\nBut, in return, you get a commandline with which to explore the program. You can type \"rails console\" and inspect the model in real time, interactively, in a very free-form manner. Debuggers are great, and I don't think this can truly replace a debugger, but I also don't think debuggers replace this. (And I can *partially* replace a debugger -- I can invoke a REPL from inside some problematic code, instead of firing up a debugger, and type arbitrary Ruby commands to inspect the situation.)\n\nLook at the Chrome dev tools again -- a high-quality debugger, sure, but also a console. Ever worked with XML in a language like C# or Java? Compare typing XQuery, running your main loop, edit, compile, run, edit, compile, run... Compare that with jQuery in the Chrome dev tools. Ctrl+Shift+J right here, Reddit uses jQuery, you could immediately try something like $('body').css('background-color', 'lime') -- or just $('body') to see what that matches, hover over the result to see it highlighted on the page. And if you want to try it again, up arrow, edit the line, enter again -- reload the page only if you have to.\n\nNow, compare all of that to the situation with C++, C#, or Java. I've written Java programs. I survived by loading up JRuby and using *that* as a REPL. And that's with Eclipse in all its glory, debugger included.\n\nAnother amazing thing about these environments is the ease of integrating third-party software. OK, I counted Java as open source, but my brother just spent a day and a half configuring Maven on an existing project. Compare that with Rubygems. Need a new library? In the .NET world, you're probably paying for it -- that alone makes it take longer than adding the library to your Gemfile and typing \"bundle install\". Existing library doesn't quite meet your needs? Fork it on Github and add your fork to your Gemfile while you wait for the pull request to be accepted upstream.\n\nThere's also /u/dokushin's point, not to be dismissed, that most of these languages have much better support at the commandline. Visual Studio and Eclipse have tons of great tools, many of which are absolutely *married* to the IDE. As soon as you drop to a commandline, you're on your own. By contrast, if you're just using a text editor, then the text editor is just one more of *many* tools you can glue together in true Unix fashion into a development environment. It means you're not limited to what your IDE/editor supports -- want to switch to Git? Install Git and go. Want to use [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) to merge? The Git mergetool is just a command, pretty much any three-way-diff program will fit. And that extends beyond the commandline -- for example, instead of forcing the web server and web browser to run inside the IDE, some frameworks will give you a stacktrace in the web browser with links to that exact line in (say) TextMate or Sublime Text.\n\nAnd I haven't even addressed why the *languages themselves* are better. Ruby does metaprogramming like it's nothing:\n\n    %w(customer manager admin).each do |role|\n      question = :\"#{role}?\"\n      define_method question do\n        roles.where(name: role).count &gt; 0\n      end\n\n      define_method \"#{role}=\" do |value|\n        if value\n          unless self.send(question)\n            roles &lt;&lt; Role.where(name: role)\n          end\n        else\n          roles.where(name: role).destroy\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\nAnd bam, six new convenience methods. You can see where I could add more related methods to each role, or trivially add a role. How much extra boilerplate would be needed to do this in another environment? I could do it in JavaScript. I couldn't do it in Java.\n\nPlus, no bare public instance variables -- setters and getters are *easy* because of attr_setter, attr_getter, and attr_accessor -- which are *also* examples of metaprogramming. Even though Ruby has these built in (and probably implemented in very efficient C), if they didn't exist, you could add them.\n\nThere's a fundamental difference in philosophy here -- other languages, like Java an C#, do this kind of thing with elaborate tooling. I need Eclipse to add and organize my 'include' statements, whereas in Ruby, a system like Rails can even override const_missing to automagically load my classes when needed. I need Eclipse to generate setters/getters (and it's *still* awkward); in Ruby I can type \"attr_accessor\". The closest vanilla Java has gotten to convention-over-configuration object/relational mapping is Hibernate's new attribute syntax (replacing their hideous XML cruft); Rails gives me 99% of those attribute mappings for free by reading my database schema, or conversely, [DataMapper](http://datamapper.org/) will generate a schema from an internal DSL in my models.\n\nThat's another thing Ruby is great at: *Internal* DSLs. Ever seen [RSpec](http://rspec.info/)? Even attempting this in Javascript is [ugly](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/), and I'll bet it's even worse in C#/Java. Ever seen [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/)? Even Make is uglier, and don't get me started on Ant/Maven. And the nice thing about these being *internal* DSLs is that if you know Ruby, you already know *all* of the syntactical quirks of these languages. If you know shell, you *don't* know all the syntactical quirks of Make. (This is one reason I dislike Puppet's external DSL, by the way -- it has a number of very Puppet-specific *syntax* quirks.)\n\nHaving a good internal DSL requires either abusing a preprocessor (which Java doesn't even have), or a sufficiently flexible language, which probably includes some form of dynamic typing.\n\nSo, it'd be nice to have better tooling, sure. It'd be great if we could have the best of both worlds. But for the moment, the most dynamic languages with (IMO) the most flexibility and most interesting semantics are also, almost universally, the languages with the least IDE-style tooling. So it's up to you whether you'd rather have IDE-style tooling like IntelliSense, or much more readable code with in-language, metaprogramming-wizardry tooling.\n\nSwitching to Eclipse feels like going forward five years in tooling, and back fifteen years in language design.",

Why would Bush bother paying Osama bin Laden? If he can be trusted to keep a secret, why can't SEAL Team 6, who are paid and hired, among other things, for their ability specifically to maintain secrecy?\n\n2. The crash happened 3 months after bin Laden was killed. Why wait 3 months? That's more than enough time to \"spill the beans.\"\n\n3. Only part of the team died.\n\n4. What does killing Osama bin Laden accomplish in terms of expanding control over the population? Doesn't it make more sense to keep him alive and make him seem like even more of a threat so as to expand military spending and get more money into the hands of the MIC?\n\n5. If bin Laden is a paid actor, then why would he be holed up in a cave somewhere in the Middle East anyway, where insurgents could potentially blow his cover? Why wouldn't he be stateside in a top-secret bunker or somesuch? (And you must think he was a real person in the Middle East, otherwise the assassination of the SEAL Team, which you think happened, would have no reason to happen at all.)\n\n6. If he was a paid actor whose only role was to get the American people to buy the story, why not bring his body back to show everyone? Wouldn't that kind of be the whole point of killing him? This didn't happen which leads me to think either he wasn't killed (and therefore there was no mission and no need to kill off the SEAL Team), or there was some other reason for taking him out (such as the official story, or something else which is even more unlikely IMO).\n\nEDIT: clarified \"the SEAL Team's assassination\" --&gt; \"assassination of the SEAL Team.\" Plus, added that first paragraph.",

Osama had a very well-documented family history and had actively worked to advance his own causes and beliefs prior to 9/11. \n\nBut let's take a look at this assertion. Was President Bush intelligent enough to orchestrate a massive conspiracy so early in his presidency? The massive manpower required to do this, and the complete sociopathy required to murder thousands of American citizens makes it rather doubtful. Would you want to work all your life to be elected to public office, just to murder people to some unknown end? Would anyone?\n\n&gt; Since then, there have been several \"National Tragedies\" that I believe are staged in order to take away citizen's privacies and freedoms (Sandy Hook and gun laws).\n\nWhat part of the children massacred in Sandy Hook was staged? Please elaborate. \n\nIn order to orchestrate staging in this particular instance, 24+ children would have to join the Witness Protection Program simultaneously and be removed from their families. Then, in full view of the media they would have to lie through their teeth. Once moved to new locations, these families would all have to remain complicit in this lie for the rest of their lives. If ONE child of this shooting is recognized, then EVERYONE is exposed. Do you think the media is capable of uncovering something so difficult to cover up? I do. \n\nYou mention several national tragedies but only cite Sandy Hook. What other national tragedies were staged? Why is it that gun control laws were not passed on a national level, and they were only passed in states that had largely Democratic legislatures? If we were smart enough to take away your guns, we would have done it already through some massacre of an entire town, because it takes more than the deaths of 20 elementary school students, many of them kindergarten students, to get gun control passed on a national level. \n\nAsk yourself: How easy is it to procure a gun in this day and age? I live in a state that has OPEN CARRY LAWS. I CAN CARRY A GUN IN PUBLIC. NO PROBLEM, JUST NEED A LICENSE.\n\n&gt; When Obama's ratings were at their lowest, Seal Team 6 conveniently located and killed Osama which restored American's trust in the president.\n\nNext, let's look at Obama's national ratings. Osama bin Laden was killed on May 2nd, 2011. Obama's Gallup Poll ratings were at 44% at the time. For a large part of 2010, Obama's Gallup Poll ratings were at 43% approval, so why didn't Obama kill Osama bin Laden in 2010?\n\nPresidents normally don't care about approval ratings until election years. Neither 2011 nor 2010 was a presidential election year. 2012 was, and if you study the electorate closely, it takes a huge October surprise to move the electorate one way or another. Why not time the death of bin Laden, if bin Laden were an actor, closer to Obama's releection in 2012? 2011 had few elections of national importance.\n\n&gt; Then Seal Team 6 was tragically killed (murdered) right after before somebody spilled the beans.\n\nSeal Team 6 is composed of 6 different squadrons (color-coded, blue, gold, red, etc). 15 members of Seal Team 6 Gold Squadron were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Helicopters crash on occasion. It wasn't a conspiracy, and if it was, it wasn't a very good one. There were still 5 other squadrons completely capable of handling the missions of Seal Team 6. They have participated in many missions since the death of Osama.\n\n&gt; It all seems fishy and I'm not combined otherwise.\n\nI hope that I can at least change your views on some of these assertions."

    "prompt": "It is hypocritical to be both pro-gun and staunchly pro-life.",
    "chosen": "&gt; A counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is pro-gun, an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal, and fetuses are innocent. However, this argument doesn't really fly. Firstly, there's no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home - maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it.\n\nI'm a gun control advocate, but I don't think that the use of deadly force is, explicitly, a thing that gun owners are after.  It's more that a gun is at least perceived as effective and that death is an unfortunate side effect.  A homeowner or victim may not be able to afford or reliably wield a less lethal force.  Guns are somewhat cheap and easy to use.  Used effectively, they carry little risk.  I could ask for a less lethal method of protection, but it would include either increased cost (just to get someone to behave) or increased risk (your bat or whathaveyou might not do the trick, and now you risk assault on your person).  While the gun advocate may value life, they see it as unfair that they should spend an inordinate amount of money or risk personal harm just to prevent something that should not be happening to them.  It seems appropriate to offset the risk to the transgressor; they already know that they shouldn't be doing what they are doing.  They also know that they may meet someone who's unwilling to part with their property or accept assault.  It's less that a gun owner takes the life of a transgressor and more that the transgressor risks his own life (and loses it).  Sure, it might be convenient for the gun advocate not to defend his person or his property, but that is merely what one attempting to harm  or steal from the gun advocate *hopes* to be true.\n\n\n&gt; Secondly, even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime, it is still by its very existence invading another person's body/property if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a person/fetus into your home/body you don't have the right to kill them, but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.\n\nRemoving a guest is fairly different from removing a fetus.  Its reasonable to assume that a guest is physically capable of removing themselves from your property, but not reasonable to assume that a fetus could remove itself from your body.  One could make the argument that, provided there was consent to the sexual encounter and that one consciously took the risk of pregnancy, that someone carrying a fetus is obligated to carry it until such time as it could reasonably exist outside their body.  Pregnancy lengths vary, but are always of some length around 9 months (barring complications).\n\n\n\nI'm a gun control advocate and pro-choice, but I don't see pro-gun and pro-life as in opposition.  Very few people value life without any qualifiers.  When people are pro-life, they are so because they believe that the child that will result from allowing a pregnancy to term is relatively innocent of any real crime.  And I don't think that's particularly wrong.  But most gun advocates are in favor of lethal force in ",
    "rejected": "Okay, let me take a crack at this...\n\nQuick self-bio so you can understand where this is coming from. I'm a 26-year-old guy. I own a gun for self-defense and for target-shooting. I have a concealed carry permit, and I carry wherever I'm legally allowed to. (Usually. Sometimes I just don't feel like it.) I am pro-life, with the exception that I think it's legitimate to terminate a pregnancy if it will threaten the life of the mother, *if that is the mother's decision.* I'm also uncertain enough on the cases of rape and incest that I won't speak out against abortion in those cases.\n\nNow...\n\n&gt;By being pro-gun, you are pro-giving people the right to choose to kill another person.\n\nI get where you're coming from here, but this isn't a valid logical statement. People are gonna kill people with or without guns. \n\n&gt;A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine, stand your ground laws, etc. would be that the other person is threatening your ***property** or body. \n\nThis is wrong. In most states, you *cannot* use lethal force to protect your property. Most states have the \"big three.\" You must be in fear of any or all of these before you can use lethal force. Those three are death, grave bodily harm, or sexual assault. If you shoot someone who's taking your stuff but otherwise obviously not a threat (ie, running through your backyard with your flatscreen TV), *you will go to jail for murder,* and rightfully so. \n\nNow, that said, people are going to get shot while trying to rob a house. The reason for that is that, if someone's going to break into your house, you have no way of knowing whether they're there to take your stuff, or to hurt you. What Castle Doctrine does, is it basically gives you the benefit of the doubt in that situation. It lets you assume they're there to hurt you, so you can get on with defending yourself (if you deem it necessary).\n\n&gt;Pro-gun activists can't really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you, as by the time you know they mean to kill you (as opposed to rob you, assault you, etc.) it's likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately, the pro-gun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone else's life, without the need for lengthy deliberation that state-administered capital punishment requires.\n\nYou kind of addressed your own point from the second sentence with your first sentence here. You have no way of knowing whether they're there to kill you until they try... by which point it's often too late to mount a defense. If we put the burden of proof on the defender, then they literally have to wait until an attempt on their life has been made, which gives the advantage to the aggressor. That's fucked, if you ask me. \n\n&gt; If you're pro-gun, however, you're arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mother's health is at risk[...]\n\nRight. I'm glad you made that connection for me. Again though, I want to reiterate that defense of property is not, legally, morally or otherwise, justification for ending a human life. The common link here is, of course, the idea that a threat to my life justifies ending yours. A uniform application of that philosophy justifies both the use of a gun to defend my home, *and* abortion to save a mother's life. And that's not hypocrisy; that's integrity and intellectual honesty.\n\nAdditionally, I'll point out the other side of that coin. If the only thing that justifies ending a human life is that they're threatening your own (or even one of the \"big three\"), that means that *nothing else justifies it.* The *only* time you can take a life is to save another. Now, if you believe that a fetus is a person, with the same intrinsic value as an adult (which I realize not everyone does, but that's a whole other debate), you have to apply that morality to the fetus as well. \n\nIf you wouldn't shoot a man for ruining your career, you can't abort a baby because it'd throw off your advancement by forcing you to take maternity leave. If you can't shoot a man for robbing your home, you can't kill a baby because you couldn't afford to care for it. And if you wouldn't murder a man in cold blood because his presence was inconvenient, you *sure as fuck* wouldn't abort a baby because you \"just weren't ready for it.\" \n\nI think we overall agree, as I examine your statements as compared to mine. I don't think that any other approach is being intellectually honest or morally consistent. \n\n&gt;A counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is pro-gun, an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal, and fetuses are innocent. \n\nI'll end with relating the experience that made me pro-choice in the cases of rape, incest and threat to the mother's life. \n\nI was raised conservative, so I had Rush Radio on my radio quicklist. (I have since tired of him. I can't stand the guy and I'm much more liberal than I was.) Talk show host Jason Lewis had been impressing me of late; he had his head on right and didn't just dive off the far-right deep end. He'd call out foolishness on both sides (he argued that the Obama birthers drop it when it became clear that no one believed them anymore, etc.). And that particular night he was talking about abortion.\n\nAnd to this day I believe Jason Lewis is a brilliant man, because he took the gung-ho, Wild Bill, nobody-has-a-right-to-hurt-me attitude of the caller he was speaking with, and forced him to look at abortion through that lens.\n\nLewis said  this: Imagine you live next door to a man. This man is 280 pounds of pure muscle, but he's a child in the mind. He is mentally deficient, and doesn't really understand anything. Usually he's peaceful, but one day, for reasons you (and probably he) cannot possibly understand, he attacks you while you're watering your bushes. He's on you, pummeling you, you're going to die if you don't do something.\n\nYou have a gun on you.\n\nIs this man innocent? Probably, by our definition of innocence. He doesn't understand what he's doing. He doesn't realize what he is doing is wrong. He has no *malicious* intent, but the *effect* is a threat to your life. He can't be reasoned with or overpowered. Your only chance is to shoot him.\n\nAre you justified in killing him to defend yourself, regardless of the status of his innocence?\n\nYes.\n\nIt is a tragedy, but *yes.* You will not dance on his grave. You will not stand up and fist-pump like you would if you'd just prevented a terrorist from blowing up a mall. You will not feel good about what you just did. But you *were* justified in doing it, because it was your last alternative to save your own life.\n\nSame thing with a baby. It has no malicious intent. But it may threaten your life anyway. If the baby must die, that *will be a tragedy.* But regardless of that, you have a right to defend  yourself, because *if you die, that's a tragedy too.* "

I think the comparison between these two things is fair, but where we differ is that I don't believe we've decided as a society that we don't care about photos posted without consent, celeb or no.\n\nAs with many issues, society as a whole tends to notice what's going on when it pertains to the famous. This is an unfortunate consequence of how we are wired, and while it would be ideal to tone down the rather destructive celebrity worship culture we've built, it's an entirely different beast. When I read about these leaks, I see the greater society becoming aware of an issue that has existed for quite some time in the peripheral. This happens all the time - Michael J. Fox with Parkinson's, Mel Gibson's racist tirades, even celebrities engaging in the ALS challenge. When famous people bring an issue to light, it's not coming out of nowhere - it already existed and now we're paying attention.\n\nBut anyway, to your main point. I really want to say this without sounding preachy, but the reason that viewing the recent leaked photos is invasion of privacy has more to do with the overall effect than the individual. What I mean is, there may be nothing lawfully wrong with what you're doing, but you're encouraging the act of leaking these types of things. On the internet, pageviews matter. It reinforces the concept of internet infamy, and rewards the behavior indirectly. You personally viewing the photos is a drop in the ocean. In the same vein, you personally dropping a candy wrapper on the ground is an infinitesimally small contribution to pollution, but you know that you are still contributing. \n\nCombine this with the knowledge that the release of the photos was done without permission, and I think you have a compelling reason not to partake in the viewing.

She can sit there and tell me she wants me to suffer endless torment simply because I don't believe in her diety, but it's not ok for me to tell her she's mistaken? How is the latter even nearly as offensive as the former?\n\nBut religious people don't see this. To them, that was perfectly acceptable. Some think that it wasn't just acceptable, it's what she was supposed to do 'as a good Christian.'\n\nIt's absolutely maddening.\n\n[Figure 2.](http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&amp;b=1314451&amp;ct=6831061) Blasphemy Laws. This is something that comes up again and again, and has been pushed both globally and within the United States. This fits with figure 1, wherein we're supposed to respect (now under pain of death) the religious right to attack us. iirc the UN changed their stance in 2011 to reflect protecting religious believers rather than religious beliefs, which is a step in the right direction, but still damnable. Why don't the non-religious deserve to be protected? I don't believe the Christians of the world are any less bloodthirsty than the Muslims. While the common response Christians counter such laws with is that Islamic Nations would be free to attack and persecute people on religious grounds, *they would do it too.* I read far more often about Christianity-fueled violence than Islamic. It's just *socially acceptable* for Christians to be violent. Hell, they think it's commendable.

The mass murderer Breivik has a cult of devout followers who think he's the bees knees because he struck a blow against Islam in the name of his god. Yet we atheists are the disgusting, abhorrent, immoral ones.\n\nI'm not antitheist. I'm happy to let people persist in whatever delusions they please. I'm not their psychologist, I don't care about other peoples mental wellbeing enough to feel that they should be 'freed.' I only get involved when they attempt to restrict my own freedom for delusional reasons. Birth control is bad? Give me a single argument against birth control that doesn't involve religion or religious assumptions. Homosexuality is bad? Give me a single argument against homosexuality that doesn't hinge on religion or religious assumptions. These injustices I fight against and name myself atheist in defense of. I stand beside my gay brothers not as a gay man but as an atheist who believes that religion should not be any reason to persecute someone, *in either direction.* I am a feminist despite having a penis because I believe all humans are equal, rather than subscribing to the religious notion that women are designed to be subservient to men. I am an atheist because women deserve freedom, and gay people should be free to love who they please.\n\nI don't often post to /r/atheism because the majority of posts are just people bitching. However, I've never once thought their complaints were trivial or unjustified. More importantly, I've never felt that they were \"un-atheist\" for being outraged by theism.\n\nThe venom towards religion that's seen in atheist communities such as /r/atheism is not unwarranted, nor does it even begin to measure up to the hatred we experience daily from theists. It is very much a central topic to the community, and so is absolutely appropriate in such a subreddit. /r/antitheism should be about opposition to religion.\n\nI feel this touches on another important topic that I just want to brush over real quick. Not approving of something, not liking something, is not the same as disliking it or condemning it. I don't like plain hotdogs. I dislike cottage cheese. There's a huge difference. All to often, people conflate \"don't like\" and \"dislike.\" Being outraged by hatred directed towards you is not the same as being hateful.\n\nAnother point is that being proud of what and who you are is not the same as hating everything that's different from it. Gay people don't celebrate gay pride because they hate straight people. Black people don't celebrate their heritage because they hate white people. While it's possible that individuals here and there will do both, correlation does not imply causation.\n\nI once made the mistake of leaving \"the God Delusion\" on the front seat of my car - when I came back the window was busted out, the book was torn up and thrown all over the cab, and a cross was spray painted on the hood. The cops didn't even give a shit.\n\nBut I'm the asshole. I'm the hateful one.",

That's simply not true and is a fallacious argument.\n\nI also see a double standard here.  You also subtly suggest that Atheists should not have a right to express their opinions of theists if it's not a respectful opinion.   Yet religion by its definition promotes the notion that its adherents are special/eternal/chosen/\"saved\"/know the \"truth\" and are morally superior.  No amount of smug atheistic commentary compares to the every day message modern religion promotes regarding its superiority and the inferiority of those who disagree.  Even so, most christians would not characterize themselves as \"anti-atheist.\"\n\nFurthermore, each and every day, religion permeates non-religious peoples' lives and affects their freedom and liberty.  From being able to purchase alcohol on Sunday to a woman's access to reproductive healthcare, to laws still on the books of a half-dozen states outlawing atheists from holding public office -- very tangible, material forms of religious control over non-religious, to the typical emotional/intellectual things atheists are accused of, including a daily barrage of pro-god propaganda that implies those who don't follow his dictates are destined to suffer for all eternity and are immoral, bad people.  Not offensive to you, but definitely offensive to others, potentially as much as a Christian might be offended by an atheist dismissing their world view.\n\nIf anything /r/atheism is a meeting place where people, otherwise oppressed and intimidated into silence in the everyday world, can vent a little bit about how frustrated they are being a minority in a culture that is highly-prejudiced against them.  That these people created their own little community and want to seek solidarity in the company of others who have also recognized bronze-age-superstition for what it is, is not the same thing as wanting to eliminate the institutions or those that practice it.   And even among those who might be so bold as to \"wish for a world without religion\" it doesn't mean they would advocate any inhumane or oppressive effort to go about achieving those means. "

In a general sense, sentient creatures are capable of moral decisions, and as such, deserve moral consideration as well. If a tiger is trying to eat you, you won't be able to reason with it. You can pledge all the steaks in your fridge in exchange for it leaving you alone, and it won't matter. This is why we don't have moral considerations when it comes to tigers, disregarding endangered status etc.\n\nA strict moral vegan would consider eating any plant within the bounds of morality, but consider this. If we were to visit an alien planet, where a race of sentient squash live, is it ok to eat them? The squash feel no pain, but they are self aware, and are capable of reason. If the squash are scared of you and attack you, you could try to reason with them. You could build a relationship that's mutually beneficial. Under the vegan's standard, it would be ok to eat them because they feel no pain. Under a standard as I have posited, it would be immoral to eat the sentient squash, regardless of how they perceive death, or how much they do or don't suffer.\n\n\n&gt;They will have the same wonderful life, in the wild, even if I kill it or not.. \n\nThat's not so. It's common for wild animals to be on the verge of starvation. It is baseless to claim their lives are wonderful\n\n\n&gt;As for producing animals, in order for food, I also think this is ok as long as the animals are treated right, and fair\n\nYou will get no argument from me\n\n\n&gt;What i'm also asking is, is it wrong to actually eat meat from these factories? People make it seem like it's horrible, but I just don't know.\n\nIt's definitely not undeniably right, but if one can avoid causing pain, one should.\n\nThe problem is that terms like grass fed and humanely raised are subject to no regulation. So any factory farm can claim to be raising their chickens humanely without actually doing so.\n\nThis doesn't mean being vegan trumps, because combines and harvesters still kill and maim countless animals. You could argue that farmers should take necessary precautions to clear their fields of animals before using their machinery, and label their products \"humanely harvested\". Without regulation of such a term, it would have the exact same problems as described above",
    "rejected": "&gt; I've always thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food and not fun ...\n\nWell first, in the presence of a wealth of vegan options the distinction between *food* and *fun* becomes really weak. We'd be killing animals for foods we like better than other foods. Which is pleasure and convenience. \n\nThis is obviously distinct from a situation where healthy vegan foods are not available. In that case, and only that case can you say you are killing because you need to eat for food.\n\n&gt; ... is morally right because there animals don't understand death, like a human does.\n\nThis is really shaky ground. Small children don't understand death, for example.\n\nWhat's way more important is that the animal understands life! They form relationships and love other animals. They find pleasure and have activities they enjoy. Killing them is taking all of that away from them. Even though animals may not  fully grasp death, they all very clearly avoid it. Animals don't want to be harmed and they don't want to die.\n\nAnd they want to continue doing all the animal things that they love to do."

You are walking down the street, not really doing anything, and someone is basically saying to you: I find you sexually appealing. You have just been marked as a sexual object in the eyes of another person. You have just been commented on in an uncomfortable way.  \n\nIf a woman makes a sexual gesture to you on the street, and you are a male, you are not threatened by that woman (generalization).

Frightened? Threatened? Weird? Violated? Creeped out?\n\nThe catcalling is even more frightening when men are threatening looking, oftentimes leering at you or following you.

You said it bothers 'females.' Not 'women' or even 'girls' which would be infantilizing but at least humanizing. 'Females' uses languages to reduce women to their biological function.\n\nNow this doesn't happen to men because our society doesn't reduce men to their assets. If *just occasionally* someone hollers 'nice ass!' at a man, it is a compliment!

How can nations pursue a cosmopolitan ideal of co-humanism if there is so much divisiveness/hate within a nation?\n\nBecause you seem to be arguing from a cosmopolitan perspective, I'll answer from a nationalist one. First (you identified this as a flaw), a national identity is beneficial to the average citizen precisely because it motivates people to action. Yes it motivates people to fight in wars, but wars have been incredibly beneficial to some average citizens. just look at America, they fought WW1, WW2, the Cold War, etc precisely because of nationalism. That has greatly increased the wealth and livelihood of the American people. And what about voting? People vote because they feel proud to part of an country which has such free and liberal institutions. Nationalism motivates a populace, it's true that it can be used for ill, but on a co-human scale, what would we use to motivate people? **What modern nationalists argue is that nationalism doesn't motivate through an us vs. them dichotomy, but rather it motivates through a people's love of the particular institutions of freedom which exist in a country.** \n\nSecondly, in terms of morality, it completely makes sense to prefer co-nationals to foreigners. It all has to do with in-group/out-group relationships, which are not necessarily a bad thing. It's true that you had no choice in your nationality, but you didn't have choice in a lot of things.\n\nPretty much what it boils down to is this: I feel closer with my brother than I do with my friends, I feel closer to my friends than I do with my classmates, I feel closer with my classmates than I do with the people in my city, I feel closer with the people in my city than the people in my state, I feel closer with the people in my state than the people in my nation, and I feel closer to the people in my nation than the people in the world.\nIf you are going to claim that nationalism is silly because of its arbitrariness, the you must also claim that filial loyalty is silly because of its arbitrariness. I'm sure you have a particularly strong attachment to your family, and you had no choice in that relationship.\n\nBut, you might object, my family has had a profoundly personal influence on my life. To this I would respond by saying that so has the nation in which you live. **The institutions in which you grew up in profoundly influence the way in which you think. Your parents might have wiped your baby bum when you were a child, but the nation's institutions (such as laws) taught you how to act. Thus, it makes sense that I care more about my co-nationals than I do about my co-humans.**\n\nAnd lastly, national identity creates a feeling of solidarity among citizens which is valuable in and of itself. A national identity is a way for people to relate to one another in a way that a human identity does not allow for. A national identity is a grouping which allows for similar people with similar ideals to recognize each other. **It gives co-nationals a sense of belonging.** And honestly, who doesn't like to belong?",
    "rejected": "Note: Since I can't do a direct reply to OP without challenging at least one aspect of the post I'll challenge the fact that there is \"no real benefit\" to the average citizen. But I'll argue that this benefit comes at a cost to the greater global population (see paragraph 3).\n\nAfter reading through some of the comments, I think it's important to note the fact that we're not talking about the general idea of nation-states or governments, but rather national *identity* -- that is, the cultural and social identification with a group of people living within the same geographic area. The challenge for those of you arguing against OP is not to show that national identity is inevitable, pragmatic or a by-product of evolution but that it is a *good* thing. \n\nYes, humans have the natural tendency to categorize each other into various social groups. We've seen this throughout history with tribes, villages/cities, religions and now more prominently with nation-states. But are national identities the *best* way to socially categorize human beings? Do a person's values, personality or life goals depend totally on where they happen to have been born? Or where they happen to have moved?\n\nTo see the effects of such categorizations let's look at something more trivial like sports. Sports is a great equalizer -- allowing people to come together who may be completely and utterly different from one another (socio-economically, physically, politically, etc.). This social solidarity around a particular sport or team is undoubtedly a benefit. However, in order to create an exclusive \"in-group\" around a sports team, you must *by necessity* create an \"out-group\" around *every other team*. Even something as trivial as sports allegiances inspire riots, violence and general rudeness amongst fans. And since the benefit of solidarity is limited to the specific team in question it comes at a net cost of peace for sports enthusiasts as a whole. And therein lies the problem -- in order to unite around a categorization people inadvertently create out-groups (generally with much larger populations than the original in-group). That which unites also divides. \n\nSince national identity is by no means the only force that unites people we know that the question of divisiveness is an issue of a dehumanizing \"us vs. them\" perception. The question then becomes, which categorization results in the least amount of dehumanization and out-group suffering? I'm not convinced, nor would I imagine that OP is convinced that national identity is that categorization. We need to look for deeper qualities that we *all* share regardless of national identity. Fortunately, there are many -- we are all humans -- we all share the same physiological needs and roughly the same physical qualities, we all share consciousness and a unique subjective experience. I'm not sure these are the right categorizations either, but that's what the conversation moving forward needs to be.   \n\nTo use an argument about *how* national identity arises or *why* it exists has no bearing on whether or not it *should* continue to exist. That'd be like receiving a medical diagnosis and having the doctor explain the ailment and how you contracted it, then leaving the room. The conversation is only half over.  "

    "chosen": "lurkti's response is pretty solid, and definitely covers most of the good reasons to not hate on professional traders en masse.  I have a slightly different perspective to offer, although I also work at a trading firm so it will be pretty similar.\n\nFirst, a definition.  Market makers are people or firms who are willing to both buy and sell a security at different prices, and traditionally try to make money by making both trades and making the difference between the prices they give.  So they can try to buy at $10.00 (the bid price) and sell at $10.02 (the offer, or ask price), and if both trades go through, they make 2 cents.  This is called the bid-ask spread.\n\nNow when you \"invest\" in a company, you're buying in the secondary market (unless you get in on an IPO, which is uncommon for normal investors).  This means that you're buying stock from other people who already own it and want to sell it, not directly from the company.  So you're not actually giving money to the company, you're just trading with other people who previously bought the stock from someone else (unless they're selling short, meaning they borrowed the stock from someone to sell it to you, and they'll buy it back later.  It's not that important to the argument now).  This can be anyone from other investors to market makers. But how do you know how much it should be worth in the first place?  Who are you to say that Microsoft is worth $34 and not $40, or $10?  That's where professional traders come in.  They spend all day trading with investors, reacting to news, creating pricing models, and even trading with other professional traders, in order to figure out what the best price of the stock is.  And then you come in and want to buy or sell, and they can tell you what the correct price of the stock is.  And for that service, they charge you 1/2 of the bid-ask spread.  So if the market in Microsoft is $33.87 (bid) at $33.98 (ask), you need to sell at $33.87.  Therefore the trader who buys from you wins $0.01 compared to the neutral price of $33.88.  So the professional trader figures out what the correct price of Microsoft is, and allows you to trade there, with a cost of $0.01 for their work.  The rest of the time, professional traders are just trading with each other, and from the investor's perspective they might as well be jerking each other off since them trading with one another doesn't affect you.  The point is that thinking of traders as \"sucking money out of the economy\" is the wrong way to think about it - they're providing you the service of figuring out what the correct price is, and charging you a (very) small fee for letting you buy or sell as much as you want at that price.\n\nPeople often talk about professional traders providing liquidity to markets - that is, offering to take the other side of any trade that any investor wants.  However, I don't think this is the best way of thinking about it. Professional traders make the markets more efficient, and they make their money off the inefficiencies.  Sometimes this means providing more liquidity, and sometimes it means taking away liquidity that other traders are providing.  The optimal amount of liquidity occurs when a stock moves the \"right\" amount in reaction to news or something of the sort.  This is another place that the competition of traders actually improves the market for investors.  I don't have time now to go into much more depth but I'll have some time later to keep going if you or anyone has more questions.",

First of all, there's a chance you'll change your mind again right after the deed is done, and now you've dragged someone into your troubles. There's also the inherent risks of a partner who could turn against your consent, or simple accidents like broken condoms. \n\nMy vote would be this. Someone you know and trust cuts down on some of these risks, and you're more likely to receive understanding if you freak out after he sex. Alternatively, you may actually really like it and now you have a partner for it.\n\nSo I'd like to nix your casual stranger sex option off the table and instead, look for a nice solid lover/FWB.\n\nNow the real reason for commenting: I'd like to commend you for posting here on CMV looking to actually change your view.

    "chosen": "A lot of paradigm shifts come from the people who are ignorant about certain things. When you read the \"basics\" on something it is often hard to imagine that topic in any other way then what you have read about it.\n\nA good example might be with finding a shortest path to the fountain in the city. Many people might have been looking for that path in the past, wrote books about it. And the consensus is that starting by going 3 miles north gives you the best chance to get to the fountain. But this does not imply that there doesn't exist another way, shorter way, which diverges from that \"3 miles north\" rule.\n\nAs another example I will go to mathematics. There is a professor at my former university, who pioneered the method of \"double asymptotics\" in statistics. Explanations aside - when he was teaching he was underlying that it was nothing else but his ignorance of the mathematics which led him to the idea of double asymptotics. And he would have probably missed it if he had read the books about statistics, dealing with the subject, that were available at the time.\n\nAnother example, again from statistics (because it is my field) is regularization. Sometimes you want to solve a linear system which is unstable - that is it has many solutions. One manifestation of this is that you cannot invert the matrix of the system. This has consequences in measuring mahalanobis distance. Anyway, one possible solution to this is to add some numbers (loosely speaking) on the system. And I was told the this was \"discovered\" by a student who simply didn't know better and he wanted to make his matrix invertable.\n\nKnowing too much of the current ways people think might make you less creative and less capable to produce your own ideas and find your own ways. So here is a possible way in which uninformed opinions might be much better. In fact - encouraged.\n\nAnd I want to leave a link to the infamous speech given by J.Krishnamurti: [Truth Is A Pathless Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6Scz7_k0Gg&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=70s)",

Conversing can be one of the best ways to learn about a subject, because your views can be explained, shot down, (dis)proved, etc.\n\nBeing 'ignorant' of a thing often shows in the beginning of a conversation and is fundamentally different to 'not being informed beyond the basics'. Ignorance indeed has no place in a proper discussion. Basics however are often the best things to start reasoning from since they open up pathways for logical reasoning and thinking."

I read the statements of these kids and they don't even know proper terms for their genitalia, they report feeling weird but its what their \"partner\" wanted so they went along with it all. Usually the perps are people who have a sort of control over them. \n\nWhen you're young, those who are older than you who give you attention seem cool. Sometimes the age thing is intimidating because they know so much more. Instantly that person is given the control of the situation. That's why things like this happen. The adults appeal to the kids, give them stuff, listen to their problems and whatnot. The kids feel cool being in a relationship with someone 8+ years their senior but they don't fully understand the situation. They're being manipulated in most cases. These kids haven't even grown into their own personality. People at that age are going through so many changes and they just want to feel good. Sometimes people take advantage of that.\n\nIt's upsetting to read these statements and see that these kids had no idea what they were doing. Most of the time they don't even like what was happening, they just wanted to make the older person happy. It's trapping kids in a situation they aren't mature enough to handle. \n\nBut I would agree that situations that involve a 15 year old and an 18 year old are a little different.

For example, originalist justices (like Scalia and Thomas) generally do not find a right of privacy stemming from the US Constitution, as the word \"privacy\" is never mentioned in the document itself.\n\nIn contrast, the \"Living Constitution\" movement generally strays further from the original text, and seeks to take current conditions into account when interpreting the text. So using the \"privacy\" example from above, although the word \"privacy\" does not exist in the text of the Constitution or its Amendments, recent jurisprudence (of the last 50-75 years) has found a qualitative right of privacy protected by various provisions of the Constitution, most notably the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n\nIronically, the \"Living Constitution\" movement tends to think more about the *intent* of the Founders than the Originalists do. A Living Constitutionalist would say \"If the Founders were alive today, dealing with the internet, what would they want for the US?\" Originalists look only at the actual words of the Founders. But the Founders tend to exert more of an influence, so to speak, over the Originalists than over the Living Constitutionalists. \n\nPerhaps this is the best argument in favour of thinking about the original intent of the writers -- it actually tends to lead to more progressive results because original *intent* is used to interpret modern events, rather than allowing the words of 250 years ago to dictate our modern jurisprudence. \n\nI suppose for me, interpreting the Constitution is pretty similar to interpreting any text: you can make whatever argument you want, provided you can find textual support for it. This is the number one rule of literary analysis from every literature class (English, Spanish and German) I have ever taken. The only difference is, the Constitution is the founding document of a country. It creates an entire socio-political system, a whole way of being. So interpreting it, trying to find textual support for your arguments, becomes exponentially more important. \n\nAs a result, I believe we should definitely care what the authors thought. It maybe shouldn't be the end-all and be-all of Constitutional interpretation (as the Originalists would have us believe) but the text, and any contemporaneous documents or accounts, should certainly be the starting point. Still, the Founding Fathers obviously couldn't foresee many events that have happened since 1789, and so I ultimately fall on the \"Living Constitution\" side of the debate: how could they possibly have written or thought anything about the internet? But the spirit of their desires for their country, our country, can still be found in the text they wrote, and should be applied and considered when regulating the people of that country. ",
    "rejected": "What if we wrote a law today that was intended to do something, and it was interpreted a different way years later by people with a political agenda? When you debate and pass a law, you expect it to achieve a certain purpose and to have a very precise meaning (that's why we always have so many lawyers nitpicking about the exact wording of statues). \n\nIt nullifies that entire debate and the democratic process as a whole if the meaning of that law can morph over time until it is unrecognizable to the original. This is not to say changes to the law should never happen, but they should be preceding by a new public discourse and formal revision. Doing otherwise would be essentially like breaking the rules of the democratic process. \n\nThinking of the Constitution specifically, the Founding Fathers, for all their internal differences, had a much different collective vision for the country 200 years ago than we have today. The Constitution even included previsions for its own amendment if there was sufficient public support - so why not just do that if people truly want a change, rather than saying it is okay to change the meaning over time through a non-democratic process?"

For me personally I have NO clue which one I would choose and would have to go with the most logical choice of who I think would make the biggest impact on the world. It makes me too fucking sick to even think about it. \n\nNow, the thing I DO think is measurable is the amount of preference you have for one child over another. For me it varies depending on the situation. My daughter fits my personality more and is more calm like me and that's easy for me to be around. My son has \"ADHD\" (which I hate labeling him as because I don't like looking at it as a disorder, but a way to describe his brain) so he's very active and can't sit still. It can be very wearing to deal with the constant movement. But because his brain loves the movement, he loves driving in the car and I can just sit there and talk to him and the one on one time is my favorite. I do think I tend to have a preference for my daughter more often because I understand her more than anyone else because of how similar we are.

    "prompt": "I think that rhetoric should take literature's place as a key subject in school.",
    "chosen": "I teach English at a local community college and, while I believe you make some good points, it seems to me that you are overthinking the issue. At their core, English classes are meant to teach students the English language. It is commonly accepted that the most effective means of learning a language is to become immersed in that language. English literature is, essentially, the deep, dark pool we English teachers use to immerse students in the language, for better or worse.\n\nIt is certainly possible to teach students all the individual pieces and parts of the language (and we do try) but this is akin to teaching musical notation without music. Students seem to retain so much more by simply being exposed to literature. It provides them with a static and proven example of the English language on which to build their own written communication skills. The human brain has an innate capacity to comprehend and mimic language and, because of this, giving students a chance to consume literature allows their brains to unconsciously soak up all the things that would have been lost and forgotten if it had been taught as theory.\n\nI know that in my experience (both as a student and a teacher), nearly every obstacle a student might run into while learning the English language can be solved through more reading. Nearly all students who struggle in English are not readers in their free time (and are rarely readers even when their grade depends on it) and the students who do well in English classes are usually habitual readers.\n\nYou also seem to be deeply underestimating how large a role rhetoric plays in the typical American public school. All the lessons you learned in school about writing and giving presentations were essentially tutorials in rhetoric without naming them as such. It could certainly be argued that rhetoric deserves more focus in schools, but I assure you that rhetoric is present in American education. I would also again argue that rhetoric can learned best through exposure to examples of effective rhetoric-- of which literature is one of the largest mediums to draw from.\n\nWhether you realize it or not, you learned far more about effective written communication from reading literature than you did anywhere else. It might not have seemed like it at the time, or even in retrospect, but I can guarantee that you are better off for being forced to slog through literature-- even the literature filled with archaic language and hidden meanings.",
    "rejected": "Well firstly, I think rhetoric is fairly well covered in schools - at least when I took an advanced rhetoric class in college I was surprised to find that many of the concepts I was learning were not being introduced to me for the first time, just a better understanding of them. So I actually don't really see anything that has to change here.\n\nSecondly, literature and rhetoric are two different things. Why can't we teach both? The skills learned by studying literature apply to more then just art, you can do a \"close reading\" of anything. Literature provides cultural edification as well, something rhetoric can't really tackle as a subject since it's more focused on the here and now.\n\nI guess I don't understand why we need to replace literature with rhetoric when both are important. I also feel that rhetoric is taught fairly substantially in schools already."

Many people first make the decision to change their diet to a vegetarian or vegan one at about that age. It's the age at which you start questioning the authority of and choices made by your parents. It's obvious that someone with a concern for animals would \"rebel\" from the status-quo of meat-eating society at the beginning of their teen years. \n\nFurther, when questioned about their convictions by meat-eating folks, many vegetarians or vegans are tired of having to explain and justify their position to people they know are either not going to understand or who might be antagonistic. Hence, they'll just try and pass of their lifestyle choice as something more casual (medical reasons, health, weight loss, allergies, etc) to avoid social awkwardness and other difficulties. \n\nLastly, just check out r/vegan.

    "chosen": "This post really resonates with me. I used to be quite a lot like you, OP. I abstained throughout all of high school and early college, and actually lost my entire friend network in high school over the issue. I didn't start drinking at all until I was 20, and I was 21 before I got slightly drunk for the first time. \n\nThe decision to take that first drink was hard for me. I'd spent years abstaining and it had become a part of my identity. It felt like a betrayal of my principals, like I was dropping out halfway through a marathon. On the other hand I was curious, and also had some fear of missing out. \n\nI'm 27 now, and over the years I've learned that drinking can be pretty awesome. \n\nDon't get me wrong; I'm still fairly judgmental of the drinking culture prevalent in American colleges and high schools. Bragging about how drunk you got last night is idiotic - it's not like its hard to slam back a lot of alcohol. Blacking out and/or throwing up should be considered an embarrassment, and it's really not that hard to avoid if you're paying attention. \n\nBut just because a lot of people are idiots when it comes to drinking doesn't mean drinking is idiotic. \n\nFor starters, once you develop a taste for alcohol you can make some truly delicious and interesting drinks. At the moment I'm sipping on a modified Sazerac made from small batch bourbon, turbinado (a type of raw sugar), orange bitters, and Peychaud's bitters (which is anise flavored). It's served in a glass coated with absinthe, with a piece of lemon peel squeezed and rubbed around the rim. The turbinado adds some molassesy sweetness which is balanced out by the bitters, while the absinthe and lemon oil combine to create a fantastic scent without affecting the flavor too much. Like all great cocktails it has many layers of flavor that combine to make a complex and delicious beverage that just can't be duplicated with soft drinks. Call it pretentious if you want - I am admittedly a bit of a whiskey and mixology aficionado - but there is an alcohol equivalent of gourmet food that is worth trying. \n\nAnd of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that getting a little drunk can be a lot of fun. As others have said, don't knock it till you try it. \n\nYour self-discipline and resistance to peer pressure is admirable, but there's no shame in trying alcohol responsibly. You won't be letting anyone down. No one will think less of you. You can enjoy alcohol without falling victim to the behaviors that you object to. As a former teetotaler myself, I can assure you it's worth a try. \n\nAs a side note, if you want to go to a party and avoid drinking without making a big deal out of it, fill your glass with tonic water and say you're drinking gin and tonic. Straight tonic looks, smells, and mostly takes like a G&amp;T. ",

Throughout high school, I was straight-edge. No alcohol or drugs. I was very firm on that. \n\nI remember posting to askreddit when I was about to graduate because there was going to be a huge end of the year party that included drinking. I was still adamant about not drinking but I didn't know how to interact with people that were. I got the same shit storm you are getting now. \n\nHowever, later that summer, I flew out to Texas to visit a friend and I got peer pressured into taking two shots. The running joke between me and my friend now is that I text him every time I'm drunk thanking him to introducing me to drinking(stupid, yes but we find it funny).\n\nOther people may take this wrong way still, but OP will hopefully understand with your mindset. Having your \"elitist\" view about drinking prior to drinking, has made me more comfortable and \"responsible\" with drinking. 1) Even while hammered, I still know not to drink and drive. I'll call a friend to come pick me up if I need a ride or just sleep over at a buddy's house. 2) Just because I drink, doesn't mean I do it often. I'm not away at college right now so many months of the year I spend not drinking. I'll drink when my friends are back in town for summer or winter break, my co-workers through a party, or a friend that is in town wants to spend a night drinking together. 3) Both of my brothers were terrible with alcohol. Both have driven drunk and one of them has a DUI. Now, both are in AA and a lot happier. The reason I mention this is because I don't want my mom to have to go through this with her youngest child(me). Tying back into reason two, this is why I don't drink as often. \n\nI'm more comfortable being sober around drunk people now that I have drank. If you're presence gives off an elitist vibe, that's when people will ask you why you're not drinking. To make sure I don't get that question if I choose not to drink, I either a have a beer and keep the bottle/can in my hand the entire night(even if empty) or a plastic cup and fill it with water. If someone comes up and asks why you're drinking that night, just say that you're driving later. No one really questions that. \n\nBut even now, I still respect people who don't drink. Sometimes I still wish I had chosen that path but obviously I can't turn back time. Though, even with people who brag about drinking,  brag about smoking weed all the time, or brag about NOT doing any of those things, no one cares for those people and find it annoying. "

    "prompt": "I believe open source software doesn't make sense in our current society, as it is basically giving away work for free. CMV.",
    "chosen": "&gt; With that said, i have some trouble understanding why someone is willing to develop so much software for free when it could potentially be giving them money. \n\nI have a few small open source projects that I run. One of them is a library for C++ and Lua, and it does stuff that anyone can do, but I just took the time to clean it up a little bit and make the code clean and work well and document it. Realistically no one would ever pay me for it even though it is kind of snazzy. On the other hand, by making it open source, I've had contributions and feedback from a half dozen people that have resulted in a better library which I benefit from, as well as everyone else using it. \n\nEven if I could make some small amount of money, I'd much rather just have it out there for me and others to use. I use libraries others have written and released for free because it saves me the effort of having to duplicate that work. I do the same. The code I wrote for that library is useful to others and not specific to my main project, why should I keep it to myself and force others to duplicate it my work? That's just inefficient. \n\nI'm one of the programmers for DeltaBot too, and there's no way anyone would ever pay for our bot. However, we have received a few requests from other subs asking if they could use it or who wanted to know how it works. There's literally 0 benefit to keeping it closed, so we open sourced it once it worked well enough that other people could make use of it\n\n&gt; As we live in a society where work hours are translated into money, it seems like a waste to dedicate yourself to a product that won't give you any return. You are providing value to the user, so why wouldn't you get paid for it?\n\nWhy does all work need to have monetary return? My time spent on my open source projects wasn't wasted, I got lots of use out of them. And now others can too, I don't need their money for the project to have been worthwhile to me. \n\nBut if you don't care about altruistic reasons for open sourcing your stuff, there's also the added benefit of having material I can put on my résumé too. And being a part of the open source community can get you talking to other people about the stuff you've worked on that you would not have otherwise met, and in doing so you can learn better ways to do things and become a better programmer.\n\n&gt; Not only that, but you are potentially ruining somebody else's business by developing a open source alternative, which is to say, you're kind of disrespecting the effort and work they've put on the product they're trying to sell by not even competing for the money. \n\nFree stuff is just another factor in the market. If someone else can't compete with a free solution I've created to a problem, then they need to either improve their own product so that it can compete, provide some secondary service like support (e.g. RedHat) or doing some kind of hosting (e.g. DropBox). Their failed business strategy is not my problem. \n\n&gt; Also, can you imagine if everyone went open source? There would be no money on software anymore, only infrastructure. Videogames, for example, wouldn't be what they are today. There would be no big push for innovation because there would be no money to be made.\n\nI don't see why this matters, all software isn't going open source. But either way, there are still ways to make money off open source software. Professionally I work on MMORPG's, and even if we open sourced the game client, the users would still need to pay money to connect to our servers or to buy our services like rename tokens or new character slots. \n\nFor games that don't require some kind of server connection, there's also things like KickStarter, where you ask for the money up front to fund your project, then you could just release the finished product for free. This wouldn't work for all kinds of projects of course, but I'm not arguing that all software should be open source either. ",

Its already a thing, and many many many software companies exist that support open source projects that then provide experts on that software.  Or support as a service.  You need something added to a project but are not an expert?  You pay somebody to provide to that project, add exactly what you need, and pay them to support it.\n\nYou get what you want, the developer get paid, and the open source project benefits.

    "chosen": "This is going to be a long post, so if you're not *really* looking to get your mind changed, move right along. I am going to write up a shorter TL;DR first, and then an in-depth after. I study world religions. It started as a hobby, then it became a habit, and I just haven't stopped.\n\nIf you have any questions or are unclear on something, just ask.\n\nMost people that you meet, and from reading your post I am guessing this includes you, are woefully under-educated about the actual tenets of other belief systems. The top two that this happens with in my experience are #2) Buddhism and #1) Islam, by a mile. It's actually a little horrifying how far construed this is from reality.\n\nIslam gets a seriously bad rep, primarily from Western Christian cultures, that is not entirely undeserved, and it originates from the beginnings of the religion. Whereas Christianity's real story begins with a savior who was everything the people of the Middle East did not expect: kind, loving, forgiving, and nonviolent, the story of Islam starts with a brilliant young man who would become a soldier. But more on that later, first:\n\n**TL;DR:** The horrific things you see today are not actually the \"teachings of Islam\", but are a political tool that has been used on and off for centuries to attempt to gain control of people and gain political/societal dominance and fit it into a religious context for the sake of gaining a following. These people are put into the forefront of Western media for the sake of building a demonized image of the people that the Western world is currently having political tensions and/or war with. It's got a lot to do with old grudges, past wars, and Israel, but I am not getting into that political minefield even later on in the post, for the sake of my own sanity. \n\nThe idea of Islam being a violent culture originates from this media representation as well as a couple other key factors such as: **The Qur'an:** Have you *seen* the Muslim population's reaction to the US burnings of the Qur'an? You think to yourself, \"people don't flip shit like *that* over the Bible being burned!\". But the Qur'an is not the Bible. If you want to draw a corollary between something in Christianity to the Qur'an, the most accurate analogy you could make is that the Qur'an is Jesus. It is the infinite, untainted and most holy work of God. It was not made by the hands of man but instead those hands were merely used to make it visible to us. The Qur'an is far holier than the Bible ever has been, and the reaction it produces it proportional to its importance. **Jihad:** Yeah, yeah, Jihad doesn't mean what Westerners think it means, blah blah, we've heard that before, but in the context of actually *going to war* over your beliefs, this is real. The issue here is that these young men are portrayed as *Muslims*. That's only as accurate as it is to say [Anders Breivik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Behring_Breivik) was a Christian. The reason there are more of them than there are mass murderers of other religions is that they are in an ideal environment for cultivating new ones. An oppressed, poor population, repeatedly invaded, with lots of angry stupid young men looking for *someone* to blame, and there just so happen to be a few evil people who have some answers for them. You'd be horrified if you heard the stories these men are told. There are radio stations that do nothing but report the horrific actions (real or false, doesn't matter) of American soldiers raping and shooting young women, burning homes to the ground, and basically doing everything an evil invader would do. Wouldn't you fight back for the sake of your homeland and people if someone was doing that to your land? **End TL;DR**\n\n\n#Somewhat Rambling Explanation of Past Trends in Islam Leading to Current Image\n Jesus lived in an area that was kept under Roman rule. If he would have been a war-like revolutionary, you wouldn't even know his name, because he would've been executed the moment he was perceived as a threat. This is not so for Muhammad. Muhammad was born into an area that lacked a real authoritative presence, but rather sat on the sidelines to a large war between two great empires: the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanian Empire. Muhammad led a pretty hard life, and became a hard man. He had multiple religious revelations wherein he revealed to his followers the spoken word of God. As a manner of proving that God stood behind him, he promised to deliver his followers from the inter-tribe wars and constant nomadic way of life that the members of this part of the world endured. And he did. Through war. Muhammad and the Caliphs (think like Emperors) that followed him built an empire. The key difference, however, is that Christianity was born through nonviolence, whereas Islam was born through war. Both went to war of course, but the Muslims admit it.\n\nHowever, all of this being said, when Muhammad was alive Islam was barely even a thing. They didn't have rules other than that which was laid out in the Qur'an. Let's skip a couple hundred years and get to some stuff that might sound more familiar. Sharia. Yeah, you've heard of that. The horrific statute of laws enforced on the people of Islamic countries? Well, that's not actually what Sharia is. \n\nSharia is Islamic Law. It just means it comes from the rules of Islam. The rules come from 4 places, and in order of their hierarchy they are:\n\n* The Qur'an: This in no way describes the persecution of women and other groups that you have mentioned. Quote the verse of the Sword all you want, it's not a basis for living it's just what happened.\n* Hadith: Hadith are direct stories about Muhammad in which he shows an example of how one should lead their life. There are ~2700 hadith, give or take depending on which kind of Islam you follow (the Shii have more because they use certain ones that support the ascension of a certain Caliph). These are not at all dangerous, in fact most of them consist of things about proper grooming, hygiene, and how one should carry one's self. The next two get a little more tricky\n* Analogy: Analogy is the practice of the *ulama*, the scholars of the Qur'an, wherein they take something from the Qur'an or the hadith and they draw an analogy. Example: The Qur'an does *not* say you should not drink alcohol. It says you should not drink *wine*. However, the analogy is drawn that the *reason* you shouldn't drink wine is because of the alcohol. Ergo, no alcohol for Muslims.\n* Consensus: This is where the real problem arises. If, in your district of governing power in Islam, you can get the *ulama* to come to a consensus about a law, it becomes a law. Sort of like the way it works in democracy, actually. *This* is where these laws come into play.\n\nWhen you see things about Sharia law being imposed, you are *not* witnessing oppression by the faith of Islam. You are witnessing flat-out oppression. You are witnessing someone in power taking advantage of the way the system works to reconstruct the rules to be what they want (sounds like a certain King James, huh?). What they do in the name of Islam is **not** in the actual teachings of the faith, it is just in the best interest of their governing power. \n\nOn the teachings of Islam, Islam actually started off as a very welcoming faith that offered a lot of equality. One of the core principles was that everyone receives equal treatment in the eyes of God. It was not until the reign of Caliph 'Uthman (644-656) 12 years after the death of Muhammad that things started to shift. Caliph 'Uthman made a declaration for **one** written Qur'an to exist, as opposed to the current 7 slightly different competing versions. After he had destroyed the other 6, he set about making new laws as he saw fit. Being a man of the mid-7th century, his views on women were archaic and crude, and thus he basically declared them 2nd class citizens, and beings that were ruled by a deep lust that had to be controlled lest they give in to such unholy urges. Caliph 'Uthman was eventually assassinated, but following leaders either recognized the value of oppressing segments of the population, or else they just didn't see the plight of women as a dire issue. You see, this is not a tenet of the faith of Islam. It is something instead that Islamic leaders (note that Islamic leaders are not really \"leaders of Islam\", they are leaders who are Islamic) historically have imposed. \n\nFinally, modern Islam. Modern Islam is much more complicated, but in a way much simpler. People stick to some traditions, like the separation of science from faith, and forgo others, like the adherence to certain ways to properly wear your tunic. Modern Islam consists largely of modern individuals, who participate in life as anyone else would. What you hear about in the news and all that is exactly what you are expected to hear: that the \"enemies\" of the US are evil, bigoted, and barbaric. There are barbaric places in the world. They are not all Islamic. Not even half of them are Islamic. But you seem to hear about the Islamic ones because that is the popular face of barbarism in the West at the moment. Are there fundamentalist Islamists who follow the teachings of the Kharijites (these are the ones that *really* started the killing in the name of Islam idea, and were always a minority), yes. But are these people even close to a majority? No. And, more importantly to *your point*, these people are not actually following the teachings and ideology of Islam, but are rather following their own ideology and forcing it to fit inside of an Islamic context for the sake of followers.\n\nGoing to stop here, nearly at the character limit, and I don't have the space to get in another articulated point.\n\n**EDIT: Lol, 2 paragraph TL;DR**",
    "rejected": "I guess the long top at the top is very comprehensive and although there are certain sections of it which I disagree with, most of it is true. I myself is a moderate Muslim living in the US. The most important point is that the fundamental rules are laid down by the Quran and Sunnah (the teachings of the Prophet), and anything after that are additions made my humans.\n\nIn your case, let me explain that I have come to believe based on reading and trying to understand the Quran and Sunnah. Every human is created for a purpose, given a certain number of tasks and challenges and it is upto God to decide the result and pass judgement on them. We as humans donot possess the knowledge to do so. What you are, what are physical limitations are, are because He choose to do so and you are expected to do the best you can within those limitations. As a result, humans donot live equally (some are born rich, some poor etc), but it is God's decision how He wishes to judge people. \n\nSecondly, there is a big difference between actions and intentions, AND what you feel you need to do and what you actually do. What you feel is beyond your control, it is natural and you have no choice over it. how you choose to live your life is very much in your control. Some people are born beautiful and some are born ugly, its just how it is, but it is upto them what to make and do with their lives. You may have urges and feelings which are not condoned by Islam, and that is fine, but acting upon those urges is within your control. Thnk over that for a min.\n\nThirdly, Islam came in at a time, (6th century), when things were a lot different, and its teachings are to be followed thru the 'end of time\" I guess you can say. I donot believe in \"modern Islam\", because then you are humanly adultering a belief system. Women were treated waaayyy differently for centuries and Islam did a lot to raise their status, although I would not say they are equal, I would say they have a different set of responsibilities."

While this may bring the country into certain conflicts, it has enabled America to become the biggest player in world affairs. The amount of influence America can exert, whether that's been used for good or bad purposes, is incredible.\n\n2. You mention the U.S. military presence doesn't breed goodwill, but I think you've isolated certain regions in a certain time period. Most recently, a U.S. convoy was [welcomed with open arms] (http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/politics/army-convoy-through-europe/) during its trek across Europe. Additionally, the U.S. military, (especially the navy) is central to many humanitarian relief efforts.

    "prompt": "I believe teachers should be paid based on performance, and underperforming teachers fired. CMV",
    "chosen": "First, I will say that I am *not* arguing that the status quo is an acceptable approach to education. There are certainly tons of flaws with it.\n\nSecond, I will say that I used to agree that teachers should be paid based on performance. Since, I have become more involved with non-traditional route teaching (so, I am becoming more familiar with the system, but I wouldn't gain anything by maintaining the status quo), I've since changed my mind on that fact almost completely. This is the part that I will mostly address.\n\nThere are a few main problems with this.\n\n1. \"Performance\" is a tricky word. When we talk about \"teacher performance\" in this context, we are rarely ever talking about a teacher's actual performance (dedication, preparation, knowledge, ability to keep students interest), and instead we are almost always actually talking about *student* performance, particularly grades. As you will see in #2, a student's performance is not *always* indicative of the teacher's.\n\n2. If you are indeed talking mostly about student performance (which I believe you are, particularly since you mentioned third-party test grading), my question for you is: have you ever gotten a good grade in a class you put very little effort in/a bad grade in a class you put a lot of effort in? If not, surely you know people who have. This *might* be mitigated by standardized tests, but standardized tests can be awful for a lot of reasons. I'll give you a real-world example: My old high school hired on a *terrible* Spanish teacher (she taught Spanish II) that didn't actually teach students... anything. So, students came in with some background in Spanish, spent a year learning absolutely nothing, and then got to Spanish III (where the teacher was actually pretty good, I had her myself), where... they knew nothing. If the year-end tests were created by the teacher in question, then perhaps her students would pass, moving on to Spanish III... where the good Spanish teacher would be punished for the bad Spanish teacher's performance (or, at least she would have to lower her standards). More likely, in your system, the tests would not be made up by the teacher. In this case, the students would fail the class, potentially be unable to graduate (and/or get into a good college) entirely because of the teacher. Now, this teacher would eventually be removed from the system, but this would still produce about 2-3 generations of students fucked over by the system every time you have a bad teacher.\n\n3. To me, the above says, well, maybe we shouldn't have the tests decide whether or not kids pass the class, but rather just have them as markers of teacher performance. This is a *better* idea, but wouldn't solve the issue of the Spanish III teacher taking the fall for the Spanish II teacher's shortcomings. Students would then be unable to pass Spanish III tests because that teacher would have to teach Spanish II &amp; III in one year to prepare them. \n\n4. Beyond this all, this system is biased against those of lower socioeconomic status, who are shown to perform worse on standardized tests. I won't spend any time defending that, but if you're interested, you should look into it. But, imagine this: you are looking for a job, and one of your options is somewhere that the work will be *much* harder, you're almost guaranteed to get paid less, *and* you'll be blamed for all of it. Meanwhile, you can go work at a so-called \"nicer\" school, work less, get paid more, and everyone will praise you for your hard work. This is sort of the current system anyway, but your suggestion exacerbates it. So-called \"bad\" areas already struggle to keep teachers around, so this just funnels more funds into \"good\" schools while choking out \"bad\" schools... which leads to \"bad\" areas being even less capable of receiving \"good\" education.\n\n5. This is not really a point directly against your argument, but rather just a general statement about the sort of solution you're proposing. Education is definitely crucial to any nation's health, which is why it's constantly under fire in the US. However, everyone trying to \"fix\" the schools has never had any experience teaching! People are trying to fix something while only knowing the symptoms, and none of the problems.",
    "rejected": "A problem with paid performance is that in the US, at least, students with mental disabilities often are in the same classrooms (and take the same tests) as \"normal\" (for lack of a better term) students and also must take the sames tests. Thus, it shouldn't be fair for teachers to be judged on test scores since these mentally-challenged (apologies if I sound offensive) students cannot perform on par with students of normal cognitive abilities.\n\nYou have to take into account that many high schools offer Honors classes that separate the more motivated students (and/or better test-takers from those who would preform worse on standardized tests. It wouldn't be fair to the teacher of a standard class to be compared with the teacher of an honors class since the teacher of an honors class will get the better students (e.g. the students who would actually care to do well on tests) and not the students who don't give a damn (which is an inevitable result of mandating school attendance).\n\nFinally, if the students do well, how can you determine whether or not they did so because of the teacher or because they self-studied? Anecdotal evidence, but I have had bad teachers, but because it was an honors class, students got good grades on the standardized tests because they were good at taking standardized tests or because they studied on their own. \n\nSo while I do agree that there should be evaluations for teachers, I don't think that standardized tests are the way to go because they do have biases.

    "prompt": "People of mixed race shouldn't be referred to by only half/part of their race.",
    "chosen": "I don't understand why identifying as a particular colour is in any sense a way of choosing your identity. For example, I'm mixed (won't say the exact mix to protect my anonymity, but it's a somewhat complicated mixture). I've been mistaken for all sorts of things, though typically people think I'm latino or middle eastern (I'm neither). But you know how I identify myself if anyone asks? Third generation Canadian.\n\nI'm going to go a bit further. Black is not a race. There are more races in Africa than in the rest of the world combined. Pygmies are *very* different from Bantu, even though both are listed as black. Even describing Obama's father as Kenyan misses a lot. Was he Bantu or Nilotic or Cushitic? Something else? Black is a description, because most people don't have much of a clue about the strong cultural and ethnic differences in parts of the world not their own.\n\nHow do you refer to Indonesians? Do you distinguish between the Javanese and the Sundanese? They sure do. These people have been distinct for much longer than the existence of any one of these modern countries. To identify a man by his country is not to identify him by his race. There are no racially homogenous countries. My guess is that most people in North America would call them Asians, but they're all quite different from Chinese and Indians (though there are many Indians in Indonesia). And even talking about \"Chinese\" or \"Indian\" is to lump together a range of ethnic groups more diverse than all of Europe. The differences between a Tamil and a Punjabi are gigantic. The Punjabi language is closer to English than to Tamil, because Punjabi and English are Indo-European languages whereas Tamil is a completely different language group: Dravidian.\n\nBut in any case, I think races are a total fiction. Like, completely made up. The example I give is that Alice of race A marries Bob of race B and they have four kids, Charlie, Christina, David, and Delilah. Charlie and Christina marry persons of race A, David and Delilah marry persons of race B, and they all have kids. All of Charlie and Christina's descendants marry persons of race A, all of David and Delilah's descendants marry persons of race B. So Alice and Bob's great grandkids' great grandkids are each either 127/128 race A or 127/128 race B (if I counted that right). But the descendants of Charlie are just as closely related to the descendants of Christina, David, and Delilah... even though Charlie and Christina's descendants are predominantly race A and David and Delilah's descendants are predominantly race B.\n\nOf course, what happens after seven generations or so is that *the definition of race changes*. Seven generations takes something like two hundred years. The people of today are not very closely related to the people of two hundred years ago, no matter who they are and who you are. No one of your ancestors from seven generations ago is related to you by more than one part in 128, if you assume no inbreeding (and eventually, there is some).\n\nSo my point is that race is a totally meaningless and fictitious label that doesn't help you to understand anything at all about a person. Those three people you listed, even the one you retracted? I'd use *one* label for them. American.",

Obama, Romney, and Carlos Mencia all walk into a store. Who's racially profiled to be more likely to steal something? Who gets told a golf joke by another patron? Who gets spoken to in Spanish? The other shitty thing about the world is your experience will be different depending on what you look like.

    "chosen": "St. Isaac of Syria, an early monastic from 600AD, and venerated saint in the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic traditions, says God is not just at all. Instead, he says that God is merciful.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox tradition, while still admitting a state of being called \"hell\", don't consider that experience as punishment AND allow for that experience to be temporal. Unlike the Protestant tradition, the Eastern Orthodox believe that you can pray for your loved ones to find salvation, even after their death. \n\nTo the Eastern Orthodox, \"hell\" isn't punishment. God is purely merciful and the only negative experience comes from an individual's denying of that mercy - like those angry at Jesus for forgiving the prostitute. These individuals are in a place of pure love and mercy and their heart's are hardened by such mercy, like the Westboro Baptist Church feeling hate toward the open receiving and lovingkindness shown toward homosexuals.\n\nSo basically the Eastern Orthodox tradition would agree with you. \n\n---\n\n&gt;Christianity (and other religions) teaches that god is just, and we'll all either end up in either heaven or hell. \n\nOrthodox Christianity teaches that god is merciful, not just, and everyone goes to the same place after death. While some may experience this pure mercy as a \"hell\", this experience is not permanent. \n\n&gt;Justice (by human definition) requires that punishments fit crimes.\n\nGod is not just, so this doesn't matter. The idea of the courtroom metaphor was popularized late in the tradition, mostly by Anselm. The ancient church uses other metaphors more often, such as the Prodigal Son (a son coming home and receiving forgiveness - not a judge punishing or rewarding a defendant).\n\n&gt;If god rewards us for abandoning reason, or punishes us for relying on it, then I hate him\n\nThe abandonment of reason is privileged and glorified pretty much by the Protestant tradition, and pretty much only parts of it. Do note that many of the first \"scientists\" were theologians.\n\n---\n\nBasically, I'm not hoping to change your rationale about mercy and justice; rather, I hope to encourage you to consider changing your view about what \"Christianity\" is and isn't.\n\n",

Lewis said, “I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful, rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside.” \n\nIf you have infinite time to make a decision about whether or not to accept God, or if you could always reverse your decision, then the decision would not be mean anything because it wouldn't be binding. So suppose you are given only finite time to choose. \n\nBut why does that decision have an *eternal* consequence? Perhaps because something about God's nature, or our relationship to Him, dictates that we can only turn Him down *once*. \n\nBut then why can't those who go to Hell just cease to exist? Well, some people do hold such a view, called Annihilationism. Others hold that those who choose to deny God continue to exist as a shade-like state where they continue to hold onto their decision for eternity in Hell, always wanting to be there (as reflected in the C.S. Lewis quote). Maybe it has something to do with the idea of eternal separation of God.\n\nMind you, I do think that the problem of Hell is a serious one for Christianity, but I find other objections to Christianity more convincing. If you interested in more discussion about these debates, see this: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heaven-hell/\n\nEDIT: Here is a more promising line of thought from Mark Johnston's book *Saving God*. (Don't let the title fool you, it is more of a redefinition of God as the universe.) In his book, he discusses cases where God seems to be allowed to do something immoral by human standards of morality because God has a fundamentally \"higher\" kind of moral authority. Johnston points out that, even if were believers, we could not know if we were talking to God or Satan or a demon except through our own reason and our own sense of morality, otherwise our ability to discern God from demon breaks down and we can no longer make sense of religious experience. (We would have no way of knowing if it was God, rather than a demon, that spoke to the prophets and inspired the writers of the Bible.) So maybe we can apply this idea here to say that, if a defense against the problem of Hell is going to work, it cannot appeal to an unknowably \"higher\" kind of morality.\n"

I also no longer partake in any kind of mind altering substance, including alcohol. I regret neither my decision to have experimented, nor my decision to live a life of complete sobriety. Just my background to help you put my answer in context.\n\nFirst of all, the mind isn't nearly es delicate as you think. It's quite durable. Furthermore, I'm not sure what you mean by \"permanently alter\" in reference to drugs. Literally everything you do permanently alters your mind. Learning algebra permanently alters your mind. Playing video games permanently alters your mind. For every activity you do, your brain forms new connections and its structure and processes change subtly. Just keep that in mind.\n\nFor me, drugs wasn't just about fun. I think that your perception of recreational drug users is of a group of people that is more superficial than is probably accurate. I didn't do drugs just for the sake of partying. I also did drugs for the sake of exploring. I did drugs to understand different states of minds. I did drugs to understand myself, and what consciousness is, and what it means to be a thinking individual.\n\nIn many cases, I discovered states of mind through the use of drugs that I was later able to access without the drugs. For example, through extacy I learned what it means to not have social anxiety. I spent most of my adolescence being too self concious to dance in public. One time at a rave with extacy and I never had that problem again. Suddenly I knew what it felt like to just not worry what other people were thinking of me. I've never lost that since, and I've never taken extacy again.\n\nI have countless other specific experiences I could go into, but I don't think that's the point. The point is that I did gain something from my use, much more than just a few hours of fun. I gained profound insights into myself that have changed my life for the better.\n\nAddiction is a real problem. Abuse is a real problem. I'm not encouraging you or anyone else to go start using drugs, because there are certainly dangers. I was lucky in a lot of ways.

Different neurotransmitters and other completely biological molecules change your mood, thought process, alertness, etc. constantly.Where I'm going with this is that ALL recreational drugs in some way change the action of naturally occurring molecules in your brain. But 'drugs' are not alone in doing this, your brain chemistry can depend on the content of your diet, including blood levels of salt and sugar, which are necessary for survival. So,\n* Your mind is constantly being tampered with and being changed by completely natural things and processes\n* This means that the effects of recreational drugs are just similar (although often more intense) processes that occur in the brain as a result of drug use\n* Since the line between drug and natural substance is so blurry, there is nothing inherently wrong with drugs or using them (they're not evil or unnatural)\nSo by these definitions, caffeine and sugar could be considered recreational drugs, considering we often use them to achieve a specific state of mind (alertness). Illicit recreational drugs are part of the same idea. \nAlso you can't call it 'harm' because that's a relative term. 'change' would be more appropriate and I would say that you overestimate the degree to which drug effects permanently affect the brain.\n\nTL,DR: Drugs are no less natural than anything else that changes or manipulates brain chemistry, such as sugar or coffee, and are not always harmful\n"

    "rejected": "&gt; it shouldn't be too difficult to grab Mr. Laden and transfer him to the USA or some other \"friendly\" territory.\n\nI think that's where your argument falls short. Osama Bin Laden was a very dangerous man, usually surrounded by very dangerous people. I'm sure that a capture attempt happened, but its not worth the risk. Why take the risk of him getting away or possibly killing US troops simply for him to have a trial? Its well known what crimes he has been found guilty for, and he had a \"dead or alive\" status so to speak. \n\n\n\nMany also don't believe he deserved a trial because of the extreme nature of these crimes. I believe that wouldn't be enough to convince you, so just really think about the fact that it would have been pretty impossible to give him a trial. Too many things could go wrong, the first shot that can be taken had to have been taken in order to ensure more lives would not be lost due to him. \n\n\n\n"

    "prompt": "The term 'Reverse racism' is racist. CMV.",
    "chosen": "I think the important distinction here is between racism and discrimination. Racism, at least to me, is the systematic oppression of individuals of a certain race as a result of the policies in place. Discrimination is the general dislike of a race. The only way for \"reverse racism\" to actually exist would be if somehow the laws magically changed and white people were now being oppressed by the policies in place, but that's still just plain racism. \n\nSo, racism = the systems in place that oppress a certain race, and discrimination = an offensive statement made against a certain race. This distinction, to me, is what makes it pretty much impossible to be racist against whites. Whites have the privilege in this world, so saying something negative about them doesn't lead to any consequences, just hurt feelings. Saying negative things about people of color causes them to be incarcerated at a much higher rate, etc. \nThese pics sum it up pretty well: [1](http://media.tumblr.com/1dbf454eadfefe08f784f8b484b5e1cd/tumblr_inline_mjzxrqTx2d1qz4rgp.jpg), [2](http://media.tumblr.com/372ab2262b8b873b274fb3b421a3aea5/tumblr_inline_mjzxs0Hogc1qz4rgp.jpg), [3](http://media.tumblr.com/46efef5262a9a5c8a55d8ca865d80360/tumblr_inline_mjzxsaRPaA1qz4rgp.jpg)",

Given that, there's no such thing as structural reverse racism, because the system simply isn't set up that way. An individual black person can still be personally racist against white people, but for the most part, who cares? They don't have enough power to make that belief any more than an annoyance for white people at best because society is structured to make sure white people are on top."

    "rejected": "First off, I'd like to ask you a few questions. When's your birthday (the month), what city do you live in (population size), your race and the race of those who you are seeing get faster times than you. \n\nI start with those questions because there a specific phenomena that we know that are associated with those variables and athletic performance.\n\nThe first being the [Relative Age Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect). Basically what happens in this effect is the individuals born in the early months of a registration season are relatively older than those born in the later months. When this happens at a young age people mistake \"talent\" for just a child being older. Ex: An 8 year old born in January is relatively older than and 8 year old born in December. Then these children get more opportunities and better training because they are perceived as better. So what starts as just a difference in age, becomes a difference in training, which becomes a difference in performance.\n\nThe second effect is the Relative Birthplace Effect. Similar to the relative age effect, children who are born in basically more average or middle population cities have a statistically significant higher performance. This is because there are ample opportunities available to them in these cities, AND they can be noticed for their talent and not be overlooked by others. Contrast this with with small cities where you may not have the opportunities or big cities where you might be overlooked for other skilled individuals and they might receive better training. \n\nThe next effect occurs with stereotypes. Basically if one is told that a certain race or sex is better at something genetically, then the person who is supposedly worse will perform worse than if they did not have the knowledge that the other race or sex was better. Essentially if I was have you run a race and you had no prior knowledge that kenyan's were supposedly really good endurance runners, you would perform better than if I had you run a race against kenyan's and told you that they are better runners than you because of genetics.\n\nAll three of these things are effects that have been proven time and time again, and they contribute to an athletes performance. \n\nMoving on. Now, you mentioned the Kenyan runners. They are interesting aren't they, but have you looked closer at them? Kenya is relatively poor and to travel between any place they run. That's right they run all the time, they also run barefoot, and in order to get out of poverty they often work very had to become amazing runners to get money. In fact they have have entire schools dedicated to training these runners. \n\nNow what does barefoot have to do with anything you might ask? Well as it turns out using shoes has hindered our running ability. It is change our running technique and decreased efficiency, so it is very possible that because of how kenyan's run makes them better, not their genes. \n\nNow what does there culture have to do with their running ability you might ask? Well let's look at the [Boston marathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_winners_of_the_Boston_Marathon). Look from 1990 onwards. Absolutely dominated by kenyan's right? Well there is also a few Ethiopians in there as well. Ethiopia and Kenya are notorious for pumping out incredible endurance runners, and they border each other, how about that. So at this point you're probably thinking \"well that makes sense, they are so close they have similar genes, and that's why they run so fast.\" Well actually the opposite, those two countries contain people who's genes are MORE genetically diverse than ANY two white people on the planet. This is because human civilization started in africa, so the further you go from africa the less genetically diverse each population becomes. \n\nWhat I'm trying to point out to you here is that Kenyan's are such good runners, at least now, because of their culture, not their genes.\n\nLet's use another example, Canada. Canadians dominate at hockey. Does that mean Canadians are better genetically to play hockey, or is it perhaps because it's the biggest sport that is played up there. You can do it with pretty much any sport, if any one country dominates in any sport, their country places a huge emphasis on that sport. \n\nAnyway this has gotten long enough, there's more that I could say if you remain unconvinced, but I'll leave it at that for now. What I what to emphasize though is that, genetics, if it does play a role it is very minimal, and any differences you see are probably based on other reasons, a few cited above. Further based on all my education thus far I view genetics in sort of a roleplaying game fashion. Your genetics are your starting traits (high intellect, low strength etc.), but through leveling your character (or training), you can change your traits to be whatever you want them to be. "

    "chosen": "I think it's useful to be able to identify a family on the basis of last names, and so I think it's useful for everyone to share the same label.\n\nAnd this is exactly why hyphenation is such a useful thing. If you meet a group of people who share the last name \"Montegue-Capulet\" then you immediately understand that they are a family unit, and you also understand something about the ancestry from both sides of the family. Additionally, hyphenation also scores points for upholding some form of gender equality.\n\nOf course, it's impractical to expect people's names to grow exponentially in size with every generation - but this doesn't have to be a problem- it's easy to resolve: when someone gets married, the son keeps only the father's name and the daughters keep only the mother's - and then they hyphenate with their spouse. We can also adopt the convention that the man's name always comes first in the hyphenation - even better - now we know both their family ties and ancestry (I don't care about how it's ordered, we just need to decide).\n\nIn summary, it only takes three names (one first, two last) to identify a person, their family unit, their family ties, and their ancestry in a complete and fair way.  Saying two last names does take longer than one, but last names are only really used for official purposes, and under formal situations. And - people are already hyphenating.

    "chosen": "You sound very open minded and self aware of your situation. Props to you. \n\nBefore anything else, I want to make a few things clear. First, there are several answers to each of your questions. I'll use the answer or answers I think are strongest, but you may want to do some additional research if you wish. Second, religion is largely faith based. I will warn you that some of the answers won't make much sense someone who isn't a believer. Hopefully I can do my best to appeal to your situation, but just keep this in mind.\n\n&gt; Creationism and certain views that contradict plausible science that has been proven again and again.\n\nThis is an age old question that has been debated for centuries. Below are some of the best arguments to answer a question that is incredibly difficult to answer. \n\n1: Some Christians believe in creation based evolution. long story short, the Bible says things were created over the course of days. Some Christians interpret this as \"periods of time\" instead our normal 24 hour day. There's plenty of debate on this topic, so I encourage you to do some research. In terms of logic, this theory works pretty well. It doesn't dispute modern science like creation does. It can actually answer some questions that evolution has a hard time with, such as the origin of life. \n\n2. If you do decide to research, DO NOT read anything by Ken Ham or the traditional creationists. Their arguments are made to address a Christian audience, not an agnostic one. EXAMPLE: I found this beauty of a quote from a well known creationist website: \"Did the flood really happen? Yes. Jesus said in Matt. 24:37-39 that the flood happened. If you can't trust Jesus, you can't trust anyone.\" Be careful with the sources you choose...\n\n3. Scientific theories can be false. Science can make mistakes, yet it seems like most people overlook this fact. Essentially, there's always a possibility of science being wrong, but at the same time, creation can be just as wrong. Not a strong argument, but something Christians believe in.\n\n4. The general and classic arguments of complexity, origins of life, etc. I don't want to go into depth on these because they are fairly complicated and require some explanation. I would do some research on these issues, but please don't read one article and assume that all Christians believe the same thing. \n\n\n&gt; The fact that there is such a harsh distinction between the two possible afterlives: endless punishment or endless paradise, and the fact that someone evil like Ted Bundy, \"confessed\" and apologized for his sins before execution, would be sent to Heaven and a virtuous, amazing human being like Bill Gates would be sent to Hell because he is an atheist.\n\nThe answer to this won't be very satisfying, let me warn you. Ted Bundy was on death row for ~10 years. During that time, he reflected on his past decisions. [In the interviews with James Dobson,](https://trustingortripping.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/did-god-forgive-ted-bundy/) he seems different. Is he doing this to look better in the public eye? Is he trying make himself feel better? We don't know. Christians believe that God is fair and just. We also believe that God judges everyone for what they do. For terrible, basic example, think of accepting Jesus as getting a ticket to a hotel. However, what you did during you life determines the quality of your room. Not satisfying, I know. In the same way, Bill Gates wouldn't get the ticket.\n\nAn important thing to note about Christianity specifically is that it's not a works-based faith. I like to say that Christianity is a relationship, not a religion. The goal is to have a personal relationship with Jesus, period. This doesn't excuse your actions because you will still be judges in the end. Complicated and unsatisfying, I know. I've been there.\n\n&gt; Anti-gay, anti-contraception and other repressive movements in the name of religion.\n\nI am in the minority of Christians who support gay rights. Although I don't agree with the idea of homosexuality, I do believe that we shouldn't discriminate based upon gender. Like question 1, this question has been tirelessly debated. Here's my answer to you. I know several gays who came to our church after several years of being in a relationship with other men. For whatever reason, they came back to the church and are trying to \"become straight\". Before I met these guys, my view of gays was pretty harsh. They made me realize the love I feel for women is the same love they feel for men. I can't imagine someone telling me that I can only love men. Anyway, these guys all have the same issues: They can't develop close relationships with other males because they might start loving them. They aren't attracted to women, so there's a very real chance they may never get married. Needless to say, they are all extremely unhappy. \n\nWhat would Jesus do? Yes, he says that being homosexual is a sin. However, he is fair. My question is this: Would Jesus want a depressed straight man or a happy homosexual? We don't know. That's how I rationalize it. \n\nAbortion is simpler to explain, yet harder to answer. I firmly believe that aborting a child is killing it. Whether it be alive in the womb or erasing the potential for life, abortion is murder to me. I am not opposed to abortions that stem from rape and domestic abuse. Even though I still think it's killing the baby, sometimes killing is permissible. Killing out of self defense is an example of this.\n\n\n&gt; Various miracles and stories (like Noah's Ark) in the Bible are hard to believe.\n\n\nTwo responses: First, if you believe in Jesus and establish a personal relationship with him, it is easy to believe in his miracles. This argument is obviously towards people who are Christian/close to becoming one. \n\nResponse two is specific evidence. It's pretty late, so I can't find the exact article. However, I do know of many atheist/agnostic arguments against the flood. The article I read takes each atheist point and rebuts against it with relative success. If you really want some answers, I would defiantly do some research on your own. Despite the onslaught of terrible Christian \"evidence\", there are some legitimate articles. \n\n\n&gt; The fact that there are so many religions, and within those, many different denominations and inconsistencies. How can one possible say their belief is the absolute truth, held above the others?\n\n\nOut of every argument against Christianity and religion in general, this is the most powerful one. There isn't a way to answer this with logic or reason. The only answer is to have faith. (Warning: I'm going to get very preachy, stay with me.) I've tried to refrain from answering your questions with the classic \"God works in mysterious ways\" and \"God can do anything!\". These rebuttals mean nothing to someone who doesn't believe. This question, however, needs that kind of answer. \n\nThe only example I can think of comes from the movies. How many people die and sacrifice themselves for someone they love in movies? At a young age, this always confused me. I didn't have an understanding of how powerful love could be. Now, being older, I completely understand why certain characters sacrificed themselves in the name of love. The only way I could comprehend their actions was by experiencing it myself.\n\nIn a similar way, it's not possible for a nonreligious person to understand what a relationship with Jesus is like. I'm not going to attempt to explain it in depth. Just think of it as having some sort of \"experience\" that you somehow, all of the sudden, just know that Jesus is there. It sounds dumb, it sounds fake, it sounds ridiculous. I don't disagree. But once you experience it for yourself, you'll never forget it. \n\nSo many religious people, wether Catholic, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, etc, have experiences that are impossible to explain. How can a BOTH muslims and Christians see God on their deathbed? How can we know who's right and who's wrong? There's no answer to those questions, aside from actually being in a relationship yourself. I think about your question daily. I wish I had a better answer for you.",
    "rejected": "&gt; Creationism and certain views that contradict plausible science that has been proven again and again.\n\nA lot of Christians and religious people over all do agree that evolution exists. One of the best parts of religion is that it shouldn't be taken literally, and should be interpreted by the person. There are some people who take that the world was created in seven days and believe it. There are others who read that and think that the seven days is actually hundreds of millions of years. It all comes down to interpretation.\n\n&gt; The fact that there is such a harsh distinction between the two possible afterlives: endless punishment or endless paradise, and the fact that someone evil like Ted Bundy, \"confessed\" and apologized for his sins before execution, would be sent to Heaven and a virtuous, amazing human being like Bill Gates would be sent to Hell because he is an atheist.\n\nI'm guessing if you were to adopt a religion it would be Christianity, because in other religions, this really isn't a thing. In Mormonism, there isn't a hell. There are only circles of heaven. In Judaism, there is not much emphasis on the after life at all. I don't know too much about Christianity, so I hope this will suffice.\n\n&gt;Anti-gay, anti-contraception and other repressive movements in the name of religion.\n\nThe Anti-gay, anti-contraception, and the like movements just a vocal minority. If you were to ask an average christian or what have  you, they would most likely be in favor of gay marriage, contraception, and other such things. \n\n&gt; The fact that there are so many religions, and within those, many different denominations and inconsistencies. How can one possible say their belief is the absolute truth, held above the others?\n\nThe same could be said about political view. You have a political view that you believe to be the best, above all of the others. There may be many others, but yours makes the most sense to you. The same applies to religion.\n\n&gt; Various miracles and stories (like Noah's Ark) in the Bible are hard to believe.\n\nIf you believe that there may be a god, who's to say that he could not intervene and make miracles such as Noah's arc a reality. Fun fact; one of Moses most remarkable tasks, crossing the red sea, was actually possible. I remember watching this documentary of how a lot of what Moses did was surprisingly possible, and I distinctly remember that the way he could have \"parted\" the red sea was by simply learning the tide of the red sea, and crossing at the lowest tide possible. Just a fun little tidbit on how something that seems impossible could actually be true.\n\n"

The fact that they are social constructs does not make them any less meaningful or important. I don't really know why this reality is so discomforting to so many people. Perhaps it's because acknowledging this makes it clear that our rights *can* be taken away, and there is nothing \"above\" or \"beyond\" human society to safeguard them. But the facts are the facts, and while \"natural rights\" may be lofty rhetoric, the concept is ultimately a castle built made of sand. ",
    "rejected": "I'll do my best with this.\n\n&gt;Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.\n\nIn the link you provided it's pretty clear that the right to live is a natural right. Well, if you are ever in a situation where your right to live is being threatened, how else are you going to defend that right? To me, logic dictates that the right to live and the right to self defense are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, if you accept my statements above then we can move to why gun rights are a natural right. It's best to use examples of self defense situations. \n\nHere's an example of situation people have and could face. I'm hanging out in my house and someone (or a couple people) breaks in and they have a baseball bat(s) or some other deadly objects. If it is my right to live and therefore my right to self defense then I should have the best means of self defense available to me. Now, just to be clear, the best means in general isn't the best means in all situations, just that it's going to be better suited for a variety of situations. This is where a gun comes in to the picture. \n\nI'm in my house that now has a stranger(s) that's armed with a weapon(s), what am I supposed to do? There is the intention to harm me and I have to choose how best to defend myself. I could grab a bat, a golf club, a knife, etc., but what's the likelihood of one of those options actually being viable in this situation? I would be going toe to toe with someone who could be bigger, stronger and more prepared. What are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? \n\nAnother option I could have is grabbing a gun, which is capable of dealing necessary force within a matter of seconds while potentially keeping some distance between me and that attacker. Now I have to ask the same question, what are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? \n\n&gt;But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment.\n\nHere's the problem, if you take away firearms then there is no longer an equalizer for a whole variety of situations, just like the example I have presented. There is the potential that you will be in a situation where you are having to defend yourself from someone else that has a gun, but at least it would be a lot closer to a \"fair\" fight. Having a gun doesn't require much strength, size, agility, etc., but with things like a bat, knife and hammer, those attributes absolutely play a role. \n\n&gt;Since guns take more lives than they save?\n\nThere's isn't any proof that this is a fact. Since the number of defensive gun uses is a very hard statistic to gather, it is unknown if guns save more live or cost more lives. One thing you have to consider is if you get rid of guns, that doesn't inherently mean that those lives wouldn't have been lost by other means. If you look at countries like England and Australia, the total number of murders and crime was unaffected by their gun control measures. If you actually look at the crime and murder rates in those countries, those statistics actually increased the first couple years after their gun bans. They did eventually start to decrease, but the US has also steadily decreased in the same periods. Sure there is less gun related crimes in those countries, but crimes were just committed by other means.\n\nI feel like I'm rambling on a bit at this point, so I'll leave it at this for now. If you feel like there is an important point of yours that I've messed, I can do my best to respond to that as well."

This is the nature of a first past the post election system (which we use in the US). In the long run, FPtP systems tend to become two party systems; however, if a third party jumps up one year, one of the big parties will either take their positions to win over more constituencies or one of the main parties will die out in favor of the new third party (closest example I can think of is the Whigs in 1860, but this is not a perfect example).\n\nSo, very simply, a vote for a third party is usually worthless in the US because of our electoral system; however, if by chance a third party has a good year, you will see at least one party co-opt the ideas of it so that they can win over the people who did not vote for them.

Basically, if you have candidates A and B who are always the leading parties (50-50), and then C comes along and gets 15% of the votes one year. If C was closer to B than A, that means those 15% of people who voted C probably would have voted B if C didn't exist and they still had to choose the lesser of the only two evils there. Therefore, this 15% of voters probably almost exclusively came from people who would have voted B, meaning instead of the normal 50% for A and 50% for B election, it went 50% for A, 35% for B, and 15% for C, having A win demandingly even though the same 50% really didn't want A in office.\n\nThere is so much wrong with the US voting system I could go on for hours.

The longer you can leave the normal earrings in and clean properly, the better it is for an ear.\n\nSo the best time to do it is when the person is still a baby. You can leave the basic earrings in for multiple years and a baby doesn't give a damn, plus I think the younger you are the faster you heal. \n\nIt's much easier to have someone else (ie mom/dad) do the cleaning because they can actually see around the damn earring. \n\nA baby isn't going to mess with them out of boredom/excitement/etc.\n\nIn my opinion though, once you pass baby-stage it's all the same.

Your second assertion does not square even remotely with current scholarship on the gospels.  It's only mythicists who think we can trace all the gospels back to Mark.  At bare minimum you have Mark and Q.  Your remaining assertions are not terribly substantive.  \n\nThe bottom line is that we have multiple, largely independent sources referencing Jesus within a century of his death.  That is a reasonable body of evidence considering the status of the man (yet another Jewish troublemaker in a backwater of the Roman Empire) and the general lack of sources to survive from the period in general.\n\n**Christian Sources.** You have the gospels (and the sources lying behind the gospels like Q).  You have Paul (Galatians 1 being the strongest link, in which he mentions meeting with Peter and James in the mid 30s).  Both Paul and the extant gospels preserve earlier material, e.g. the hymn in Philippians or Matthew 12:1-8, likely surviving elements of earlier oral traditions.\n\n**Jewish Sources** Josephus in his Antiquities mentions Jesus twice, in books 18 and 20.  He also mentions John the Baptist in Book 18.  The references to John and the reference to Jesus in Book 20 are considered authentic by the overwhelming majority of Josephus scholars.  The reference to Jesus in Book 18, the Testimonium, is obviously an interpolation but there is widespread agreement among scholars that the passage contains an authentic core.  \n\n**Roman Sources.** You have Tacitus, Suetonius and Pliny the Younger.  Of those three, Tacitus is the strongest and clearest reference.  \n\nFor the mythicist case to stand, you need to explain away all of those references.  You also need to explain why somebody in the first century would invent a supposed Jewish messiah who acts nothing like what every Jew knew the messiah was supposed to be (hint: it wasn't dying in shame on the cross).  You need to explain why Matthew and Luke take great pains to explain how a man from Nazareth was actually from Bethlehem, when if the man were a fiction they could simply have placed him in the right city to begin with.",
    "rejected": "I hope that this doesn't get burried, I've thought a bout this for quite some time trying to figure out the best way to approach this. Firstly I will attack your claims using logic and reasoning and methods that are used to determine history from primary sources. ignoring le STEM circlejerk logic, and facts do dictate what is considered history, while there is room for debate most people will come to similar conclusions via exegesis. \n\nI will begin with your own admission\n\n&gt;maybe there was an itinerant sage named Yeshua who ran around, gathered a minor following, and was executed for sedition. \n\nas you are already on the edge of accepting these things as facts, and you should for good reason. everything we know from history we don't actually know, we have epistemological trust that they are true. That is we have to judge who to believe, and what to believe. For example if Rush Limbaugh says \"all comunists are bad people\" we know that we should not necessarilly believe that all comunists are bad because Rush Limbaugh is biased. We can understand that Rush, along with a fair few other people believe that communists are bad people, and that there may even be a few bad communists, but it wouldn't make since for us to believe that *ALL* communists are bad. \n\nyou have chosen to believe that Tacitus is not worth your epistomological trust, thats fine i suppose, we still have pliny the younger, seutonius, and Josephus, but let us assume that they were all liars, or wrong or missunderstood, or whatever. the question then becomes \"who will you believe existed?\" perhaps you would accept James, the brother of Jesus, or Paul the  apostle, or peter, the first pope, or the second pope, or the third pope, etc. find a person you belive exists in relation to jesus and ask yourself, \"does it make sense that the third pope would know the second pope?, the second pope the first, (i.e. Peter), and would Peter have moved away from his homeland, changed religions and died for a person who did not exist? if so what is his motive? Ockhams law would dictate from this alone that Jesus, or Yeshua, did exist. \n\nthats great news! this means that we suddenly have a whole lot of primary documents to look at, pliny is back, josephus is back, tacitus is back, the gospels are back, Q is back, the gnostic gospels are all back and useful. sure they may be propaganda, but propaganda can be incredibly useful, it may not give you the day someone was born, but it sure as heck can give you an idea about their ideology. \n\nOne thing that everyone of the primary sources agrees on is that jesus was crucified, and the plaque on his cross read \"KING OF THE JEWS\". crucifiction, as agreed by every historian i've ever heard/read was reserved by the romans for people who were trying to rebel against the empire. this would imply that Jesus, Yeshua, was a rebel, a pretender to the thrown of Jerusalem. this is just one piece of evidence that points to this, there is also the meaning of the word \"messiah\", the messianic secret, the other self proclaimed messiahs, the talk of the coming of the kingdom of god, all of it points to a proto-zealot like figure who was trying to upend the roman government. \n\nusing almost entirely a priori arguments I believe I have proven that the most likely case is that.\n\n&gt;there was an itinerant sage named Yeshua who ran around, gathered a minor following, and was executed for sedition.\n\nthis alone shatters the jesus myth hypothesis as anything except convoluted and unlikely, furthermore by looking at the texts we can draw several other conclusions, he was most likely a day laborer in tiberias until his thirties, he was most likely born in nazareth, his father may not have been known as he was refered to as yeshua bar mary which would have been an insult, he was most likely john the baptists disciple, etc. \n\nin conclusion the most likely case is that jesus did exist, every other hypothesis has much less evidence, and is much more convoluted following ockhams razor a historical jesus is the most likely true case. furthermore using the primary documents, even if they are bald faced lies, we can draw conclusions about the life and times of jesus.\n\nEdit: if you'd like I can use this process i outlined above to get information about Abraham lincoln, using only abraham lincoln vampire hunter as a source.

If one had only STEM major critical thinking skills, they would lack the necessary critical thinking skills to analyse language and meaning.\n\nThe way I see it, subjects such as science and art transfer different types of ideas and reasoning to each other. I thought Feynman's experience as an artist was intriguing. \n\nPersonally, my formal education is in both English and psychology, and I find the reasoning of each complementary. In the end, scientific reasoning has its limits. So much of where science begins is with anecdotal stories, intuition, serendipity, pattern recognition, and so on. The humanities takes a lot of critical thinking, and such critical thinking often leads to hypotheses.

No matter what lighting you use to display it or how hard you work, you will not be able to compete with the versatility and range that marble has. \n\nThink of the number of big budget movies with legendary directors who have put out a movie ruined by a single actors in ability to act.

For reference, I work in theater very often, and in the amatuer scene the writing and directing is almost always -not great-. But you know the \"good\" actors in your area, and without ad libbing lines or without disobeying stage direction, they still take absolute horseshit and polish it into something fascinating to watch. \n\nAt the end of the day the best analogy is really what we are actually talking about, all the direction and planning in the world is just building to execution, and any profession with that disconnect between planning and execution will tell you execution is the most important part.",

It's amazing to see how people can make monologues come to life. With many people performing the same monologue, it's fascinating to watch how some absolutely make it come to life (without lights, directors, etc) while some end up just reciting lines.\n\nI wouldn't think of it as everyone is a good actor; rather, with good actors, the script/directing/cinematography serve to ENHANCE their acting, whereas with only competent actors those elements serve to MAKE UP FOR their decent acting. A great actor could do what he does without the help of all these things, whereas a bad one needs those things to make the film seem good."

I linked to the Marine version, because that was my branch of service. It covers everything. Interview techniques, resume writing, unemployment benefits, how to decompress, etc. You literally cannot separate without sitting through the program. This problem is that it can be kind of dry. It's definitely not the worst training out there, but it's a far cry from the best. Within that transition assistance program, you're given a list of military friendly websites that will assist you in finding a job. They describe how to translate your skills from the military to is civilian equivalent such as a sergeant is a supervisor. There are also tons of numbers you can call for assistance as well, so you're not staring at a person-less website.\n\nYou mentioned suicide rates, PTSD and other medical ailments that plague veterans. No matter what is in place, there will always be veterans that snap from stress, but what is in place are VA hospitals and [hotlines](http://veteranscrisisline.net/) that are available to all veterans regardless of what they did in the service. I've been going to therapy for about two years. I started towards the end of my service, and I've been attending since I've gotten out. I'm also on various medication to help me cope. The problem is not that there aren't things in place to help veterans; the problem is that veterans are not taking advantage of what is available.\n\nI mentioned that transition program earlier. In the Marines, it's a week long. The real problem is that many of the people that are getting out are around 22. They view it as another check in the box to just get the hell out of the service. It is stressed that you *need* to pay attention to the program, because the information in it is invaluable. So there is plenty in place to help veterans transition. The problem is their, \"I don't give a fuck about this class. Just sign my got damn sheet and let me the fuck out,\" attitude. But we cannot force every veteran to go to speak to a therapist or psychiatrist upon separation. We can't force veterans to call the crisis hotline when they're feeling stressed.

As a veteran I can tell you that we were regularly \"trained\" on how to spot the signs of PTSD in our peers. We were encouraged to provide a sense of community for each other as we were away from our families and need it. The biggest hurdle that I saw to helping veterans with PTSD is not a military issue, it's the ingrained cultural mindset that \"brave people\" don't get scared, cry, act \"cowardly\". Yes, machismo is more pronounced in the military world, but when vets leave that word and join the civilian world they are still in a culture where they feel they will be seen as \"less brave\" or weak if they need help. Also, being immediately asked \"How many people did you kill?\" and questions like that when you tell someone you're a vet just serves as a reminder of the horrible experiences and that you are different. Those types of questions make some vets feel like they are not part of the communities they left when they joined the service. They are different. They are unfamiliar. Those who are around them don't understand. That is the bigger issue. That is what contributes to veterans feeling isolated and alone, unable to seek help."

    "chosen": "I debated whether to respond to you or simply to post this to /r/badeconomics and be done with it, but decided on the former.\n\nYou have 2 separate views here: 1, where you have some misunderstanding about what it means to be in economic crisis, so you come up with pearls like \"The European crisis is the hoax of the century\", and 2, where you are saying that you disagree with the economic indicators we use to measure economic wellbeing (I am talking about your assertion that the EU is doing great based on things like gender equality and HDI). I will start with CMV1.\n\n\"Economic crisis\" is a bit of a hand-wavy word, but what it's getting at is the general conditions of a recession, which has a specific definition: it means negative GDP growth for two consecutive quarters or more. [As we can see here] (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG/countries/EU?display=graph), the EU experienced a double-dip recession starting in 2008 and is currently in recover from the second dip, which began in 2011 - which is exactly what you would have been told in any mainstream media outlet. Since a recession is a sufficient condition for calling a situation an economic crisis, I think we can agree here. But, on top of that, it is extremely true that the unemployment situation in the South is very bad, as is the fallout from the social security obligations which you like so much. The latter two issues are examples of the EU's structural economic crisis, which is the specific thing everybody's worried about. It differs from your run of the mill recession because it is caused by the economic system not working, and can only be fixed by reengineering that system.\n\nNext, you're making the common American mistake of assuming that the EU is a country. Which it's not. We must further make a distinction between the EU and the Eurozone (which countries like the UK or Sweden don't belong to), and the Schengen area. The EU crisis, debt or otherwise, disproportionately affects the Eurozone, because the price of the Euro essentially reflects everything every Euro country does. Finally, because of the way EU legislation works, each country is basically free to implement whatever economic policies they want, which makes a whole lot of variation in economic performance across the board, which you also will have heard in any mainstream media outlet: some EU countries are doing pretty well through the crisis, but other EU countries are not, and on average the EU is in the shitter. Edit: [this map of male unemployment by EU country just got posted on dataisbeautiful] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53fe168be4b0826cfdf954c8/t/551bf89de4b0f5016a1c4a6b/1427896480378/?format=1000w). I'm linking it here as an example of the extreme discrepancies in economic health within the Union.\n\nTake Italy. Its financial system actually got through 2009 almost unscathed, because Italian banks are highly conservative lenders. However, because Italy relies in large part on a luxury export economy, its employment and housing prices went down by a lot and still have not recovered. 20 years of economic mismanagement under Berlusconi (both huge fiscal obligations and corruption) came to fruition during the crisis, and here's your debt crisis - which cannot be solved by fiscal contraction because of Italian politics. But more seriously, Italy, like many other southern EU economies, is suffering from a structural problem: it has no viable productive economy with which to make money. This structural issue has laid unsolved for several decades, as is reflected demographically: the average marriage age in Italy is ~32, and 54% of people aged 20-34 still live with their parents, largely due to [economic problems] (http://www.demogr.mpg.de/papers/workshops/000906_paper01.pdf). Whilst Italians receive all sorts of social benefits, they are paid less than Americans before taxes, and pay more in taxes on top of that, which results in a less mobile population, especially economically. Indeed, countries like Sweden are microcosmic exceptions: their economic model doesn't create prosperity in other countries of the EU.\n\nSo, CMV2. The notion that we use too narrow a set of, or even the wrong indicators to measure economic prosperity has been brought up multiple times in the discipline. Joseph Stieglitz and Amartya Sen, among others, have been the most illustrious critics of using GDP and its derivatives to measure economic development, but also economic well-being. However, this debate is not GDP vs. people's feelings: this debate is about present value of consumption vs. future value of consumption. The reason GDP is a shitty overall indicator is that it doesn't say anything about where the economy is going - only where it is right now. For instance, oil-rich countries today may have a GDP of a billion zillion dollars, but once they run out of oil or oil prices crash, so does their GDP. Economic well-being, on the other hand, is meant to reflect an economy that can be reasonably resilient to the things life throws at it - a diversified economy governed by stable institutions. We believe that robust sources of revenue are manufactured goods, technological innovation, human and institutional capital, so on - and we try to track for those with measures like HDI. But these indices are fundamentally attempts to shadow-price intangibles in addition to production - they're not meant to replace GDP. \n\nYou could say that, hey, in many countries of the EU, people are more educated than in the US, they are more equal than the US, they live longer than the US - doesn't the EU have good human capital? And yes, it does. But many countries in the EU fall behind on issues like the tax burden, the ease of opening a business, dependency ratio (aging populations coupled with high fiscal obligations to seniors are a huge problem in countries like France, Italy, UK, by the way), youth employment, etc. The overall health of the economy is hard to measure, but generally speaking, the US finds it far easier to jump-start its economy after economic crises because it doesn't face legislative roadblocks or sticky benefits in any way at all close to how big these problems are in the EU. And US inequality does, nonetheless, drive hard work. Without a doubt, the average EU citizen has a higher quality of life, but what we're worried about today is whether that quality of life is sustainable in the long term.\n\nEconomic well-being is very simply the ability to maintain a constant or growing consumption in the economy every year. In order to consume, you have to produce (which is why GDP is important). Things like unemployment, debt, lack of consumer confidence, extreme wealth inequality, delayed entry of young people into the workforce all have a depreciatory effect on production, which, even if it doesn't affect the economy that much today, will catch up with us later. That's why the EU is in deep crisis - because the things I have named are screwed up for structural reasons, meaning they won't get fixed when the global economy gets fixed - they will only get fixed when the EU gets its shit together and manages itself properly.\n\ntl;dr economists aren't neoliberal overlords. Sometimes they have useful things to say about the world.",
    "rejected": "&gt; Even in a deep recession, most Europeans are far better off\n\nYour definition of \"better\" seems to be highly **subjective** based upon the metrics that *you* find valuable:\n\n* Income equality\n* Life expectancy\n* Education (test scores)\n* Environmentally responsible consumer habits\n* Mother's and children's rights\n* Nonviolence\n* Economic mobility\n* Inequailty-adjusted HDI\n\netc.\n\nYou say those are the measures of development for the US, but for lack of a better term, you \"cherry picked\" the statistics that define development based upon your subjective belief in their value, when there are so many others that can define development as well - not to mention, I'd argue quite a few people would disagree with your metrics as the defining measures of human development such as mother's and children's rights (which vary considerably even in Europe) and environmentally responsible consumer habits (for instance, Europe is far more reliant on foreign oil from the Middle East or Russia, all questionable regimes, than the US which gets most of its oil from Canada, Mexico, or domestically). \n\nNot to mention, quite a few of these metrics are debatable to begin with. For instance, education (test scores): aside from the fact that test scores between countries are considered only one of many metrics to measure actual educational performance/attainment, you're also ignoring the other metrics that paint the US in a far different light when it comes to education.\n\nAs an example, the US dominates the top university rankings in the world, with a disproportional number of schools. You can see that quite clearly when you consider that the US has more international students than any other country in the world by a fair margin - [18% of all total worldwide international students](http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/international-student-flow-viz.aspx) go to the US for their studies.\n\n&gt;I'm not implying a conspiracy here, but left-wing European social democracy is proven to work and \"the crisis\" is a complete phantom based on bad statistics and silly misunderstandings; even Jeb Bush recognizes that.\n\nProven to work? I'm not sure one can conclude that so quickly when there are social democracies in Europe that have serious problems today (I'm looking at you, Greece) that haven't been resolved for years.\n\nNot to mention, quite a few of those countries have only recently adopted social democracy and so the long-term impacts are only now being gauged.\n\nIn addition, there are countries that are potentially ticking time bombs (like Spain). \n\nAnd if you recall, from the 2008 crisis, a lot of measures put in place were designed to fix the fact that European banks were even more overly-leveraged than US banks, an issue that may be compounded with growth problems in the future.\n\nThe issue that a lot of economists are worried about is the low growth rate of a lot of the countries in Europe, something that might not be an issue a few years at a time, but something that will grow increasingly problematic in the future, especially as the center of the world economy shifts increasingly away from Europe and towards the rapidly growing economies in Asia and elsewhere in the developing world.\n\nA lot of what the US faced a few decades ago when it had the highest development in the world (and its cost of living far outstripped many others in the world) are also starting to show up in Europe. For instance, a lot of American corporations once outsourced work to Europe in places like Italy or Eastern Europe after the Cold War ended - but as the development levels in Europe has picked up and costs increased there, those jobs are being re-outsourced to cheaper countries in the world. \n\nIn addition, Europe has a high rate of youth unemployment. Again, that might not be an *immediate problem*, but what if that continues for another 5-10 years? We're already complaining about the low growth rate, increasingly competitive and scarce job market - what will those currently unemployed 18-30 year olds be like if they continue to be doing if unemployed in 2020 or 2025?\n\nThese issues compound - a year or two of low growth rate can be understandable. A decade of barely beating inflation, or even outright falling behind inflation? \n\nEveryone might be more economically equal today, but if everyone is getting poorer together, especially relative to the world, it is inevitably going to bring those rankings down in the long-term because worldwide development doesn't stop. Stop growing, however, and your development will stop as well."

    "prompt": "Kanye West is overrated and mediocre.",
    "chosen": "Let me give you every reason that Kanye West is nothing but an undeserved scapegoat, who had provided nothing but top-tier music since his debut. Let me school you with some straight facts:\nKanye, despite his publicity stunts, is regarded by many as a kind, compassionate individual. He often talks to his fans, and from all accounts is genuinely interested in what they have to say, what their life is like, and what their goals are. This is somebody who for the past nine years has been public enemy number one. It would be easy for him to go into absolute seclusion, and bitterly resent everybody, but he doesn't. He has a passion behind what he does, and it reflects in his music. Rick Rubin regards Kanye as the most influential and groundbreaking artist in hip-hop at the moment. Paul McCartney regards Kanye as a genius. He invited Seth Rogen and James Franco to perform their \"Bound 3\" parody at his wedding. He has won the love and respect of anybody who genuinely takes an interest in his music (Which has won 21 grammy awards, might I add). Despite the VMA incident, Kanye and Taylor Swift are good friends, and Swift herself has a deep respect for Kanye as an artist.\nNot to mention, the dude has not had it easy. He slaved for years as a producer before finally making his big break on the production for Jay-Z's Blueprint, with beats for Ain't No Love (Heart of the City) and I.Z.Z.O (Takeover). Despite his success as a producer, everybody told him he couldn't rap, and would never make it.\nHe eventually dropped College Dropout in 2004, reinventing the game with an album full of incredible soul-beats at a time where everybody was still trying to copy the G-Funk West Coast vibe Dr. Dre's 2001 had left. The album had smash hits like Through the Wire, where he rapped about his near-death experience in a car crash while STILL WEARING his reconstructive mouthgear; or his club-hit about Jesus in Jesus Walks, at a time where you weren't going to get anything religious on the radio unless you're on country/gospel station in the South.\nLate Registration debuted 2005, with a completely fresh Soul sound, and featuring the talents of Adam Levine (Maroon 5), Nas, Jay-Z, and of course Jamie Foxx in his smash hit \"Gold Digger\". I don't care who you are, this song had everybody dancing and was played and still is played in every club from New York to Tokyo to Berlin. His other single \"Diamonds From Sierra Lione\" touched on the issues of Blood Diamonds and the exploitation of Africans by Africans\n\"Over here, its the drug trade - we die from drugs/ Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs\".\nThis album also has one of his most heart-felt songs Kanye has produced to date: \"Hey Mama\", his tribute to his mother Donda West, who raised him as single black mother in Chicago, with all the trials and tribulations that brought. The song is a beautiful display of a man who has a deepfound respect for the one who gave him everything.\n\"I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi/ Late december, harsh winter gave me a cold/ You fixed me up something that was good for my soul/ Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?/ You worked late nights just to keep on the lights/ Momma got the training wheels so I could keep on my bike/ ... and it don't gotta be mother's day/ or your birthday for me to just call and say: 'Mama!' I wanna scream so loud for you/ cause i'm so proud of you.\"\n2007 Kanye released Graduation. This was a completely new sound to his previous Soulful works. This had a heavy techno/EDM inspiration, from artists such as Daft Punk, in addition to the influence of House Music with its Chi-town origins. His hit song \"Stronger\", sampling the also famous Daft Punk song \"Harder, Better, Faster\" was played once again world-wide in every club from L.A. to London to Sydney. It was groundbreaking, as Kanye melded genres that nobody had been able to meld. He gave popularity to the Robotic Voice trope that many artists copy to this day, and re-purposed auto-tune. It was no longer for untalented hacks who couldn't sing: It was for artists who wanted to give a specific feel to their music.\nThen by 2008, things really started going south for Kanye. His mother passed away due to complications with a cosmetic surgical operation, his relationship with his girlfriend was deteriorating, and he had a hatred of himself. It was in this despair and desperation that he produced his darkest work, \"808s and Heartbreaks\", which is essentially his thesis on pop music, providing us with an incredible set of pop beats, all of which were phenomenal, and embracing the cold, detached Robot Voice that he had popularized as a way of reflecting the depression and lack of joy and humanity he possessed. The album provided him an avenue to channel the dark times he was going through. The track \"Coldest Winter\" is directly about the passing of his mother, Donda\n\"It's 4am and I can't sleep/ Her love is all that I can see/ Memories made in the coldest winter/ goodbye my friend, will I ever love again/ If spring can take the snow away, can it wash away all our mistakes?/ Memories made in the coldest winter/ Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again\"\nThen, in 2010 Kanye releases his Magnum Opus, \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\". Critically acclaimed and regarded by many as the greatest rap album of all time, this album blew everybody out of the water, with not a single bad track. It received the near impossible 10/10 rating by Pitchfork, putting it in the same league as \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"Abbey Road\" by the Beatles, \"London Calling\" by The Clash, and \"Animals\" by Pink Floyd. It was deeply self-reflexive, and in most senses a powerful declaration that he was not defeated, that he is in fact at the top of his game and that nothing can stop Yeezy season approaching. His song \"Power\" is nothing short of an inspiring, uplifting, empowering composition which firmly asserts that Kanye is back, and he does not give a flying fuck.\n\"Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it/ I guess every superhero need his theme music\".\nHis other single \"All of the Lights\" has a whopping fifteen extra artists, including Rihanna, Elton John, Fergie, Kid Cudi and many others. I could write a whole essay on Runaway, or Blame Game\nThen, in 2013 Kanye released \"Yeezus\", a.k.a. ABSOLUTE GENIUS. It is his anti-hiphop album of harsh, grinding samples, and disjointed jarring beats that comes together and by no sense of reason create some beautifully profound music. He denounces the institutional racism of the DEA and the CCA in his controversial track \"New Slaves\". He mocks the hubris and egocentrism that everybody sees him as having in his track I am a God, which takes the absolute piss out of the modern man who considers himself a god, with the absurd line\n\"I am a God/ So hurry up with my damn croissants!\"\nKanye has stopped caring what people think about him a long time ago.\nBut that's not what makes the album ABSOLUTE GENIUS. It's the fact that the entire album is in fact an allegory depicting the Tragic fall of the \"Yeezus\" persona, going from absolute stardom and egotism with the strong, hard hitting, angry, egotistical tracks On Sight, Black Skinhead, I am a God, and New Slaves.\nNow I've been writing this comment for the past hour, so I won't even go into his non-musical exploits, but rest assured that as far as fashion goes, Kanye West is leading the forefront with his Red Octobers or Yeezy Boost Sneakers with a resale value of several thousand dollars each.\nNow, I hope that if you actually took the time to read at least half of this, you will see that the hatred for Kanye is little more than an attempt to marginalize one of the greatest artists of our time. His outbursts, though not classy, are not unfounded. Heck, John Lennon literally said the Beatles were bigger than Jesus; if that's not hubris I don't know what is. Both Lennon and West are icons and artists who have changed this world forever. Just because you haven't taken the time to see further than your limited frame-of-reference by no means makes Kanye a bad artist or a bad human being. He is God sent, and full to the brim of musical talent. His new album will undoubtedly bring another wave of incredible artistry.",
    "rejected": "This is taken from another thread that answers the question:\n\n**\"Why is Kanye considered to be so great.\"**\n\n\"The first and biggest reason is his discography. Not only does he have arguably the greatest discography in hip-hop but it also is among the best in the entire world of music. His first five solo albums are considered classics among hip hop heads everywhere and although his Yeezus got mixed responses, it is on its way to being a classic as well. His fifth studio album, MBDTF is considered by some to be the greatest hip-hop album of all time and is personally mine and many others favorite album ever.\n\nNot only does he have solo album success but his collab album with Jay-Z (Watch the Throne) was generally well received. His other collab album Cruel Summer, although not up to his normal standards had a few big hits, including Mercy, undoubtedly the biggest song of last summer.\n\nHis production work is legendary as well. In addition to producing the majority of his own body of work, he also produced many hits for Jay-Z like \"Lucifer\", \"Heart of the City\", and \"Izzo(H.O.V.A)\" among many others. He also produced the entirety of Common's album Be, which many consider to be Common's greatest.\n\nHis lyrics are often clever, and while some may be considered \"nothing special\" especially on Yeezus, many times he speaks about meaningful and personal topics like on \"All Falls Down\",  \"Hey Mama\", \"Everything I Am\", \"Welcome to Heartbreak\", \"Gorgeous, and \"New Slaves\" (to name only one from each album.)\n\nThis only scratches the surface of the greatness that is Kanye West. Kanye significantly influenced hip-hop by breaking down the gangsta image of rappers. Each album has a different sound, and often lead the way in breaking down the sonic boundaries of hip-hop like on 808s and Heartbreak and Yeezus. He is a commercial and critical success, and has influenced the majority of rappers on the scene today.\n\nWhat many people see as egotistical and arrogant, his fans see as self confidence. This self confidence infects us through his music and encourages us to believe in ourselves. He dreams big and in turn inspires his listeners to do the same. He has had a significant and meaningful impact on my life, and many others as well.\""

    "chosen": "I would like to say that when a person is drunk they still are themselves. They are perhaps a different facet of their public personality. But they are still themselves. It is proven that drinking lowers inhibitions. This is why people cheat. I guarantee you, that no one has ever cheated on a spouse while drunk, that didn't want to. Do they regret it in the morning? Absolutely! But that cheater, is still a very small facet of their personality. \n\nAlcohol does not alter the brain to such a degree, that it will force a person to act outside of their character. If you feel that a person is acting outside their character, it is because they have hidden areas of their character, that self control usually keeps in check. When drunk, those parts are uninhibited to varying degrees.\n\nSomething to consider is how do people react to alcohol? The answer is, that everyone reacts differently. Why? Because they are still themselves. Unlike other drugs, say heroine, where anyone high on heroin acts the same as anyone else on heroine. Why? Because it is the drug telling the body what to do.\n\n&gt;Your opinion of when you've had enough is different when you're sober to when you're drunk. Your first drink was taken by your sober mindset, the second by the mindset created by the first, the third by the second, and so on. Your sober mind doesn't have control over every drink as soon as you've had your first\n\nWhat you have described here is an alcoholic. Most people who have spent any amount of time drinking know when they have had enough. They also, even in their drunken state, know that they are drunk. The only people I have seen react to alcohol the way you have described are inexperienced drinkers, alcoholics, or people who are allergic to alcohol.",
    "rejected": "I'm confused... You say\n\n&gt;This is the point in the discussion where people normally say \"But they chose to get drunk, therefore they need to deal with the consequences!\"\n\nbut then offer no rebut for why this isn't a valid opinion. Even though you might make foolish decisions while drunk, it is ultimately your responsibility to control and moderate what enters your body and how that affects your decision making. Your actions are still your responsibility because you chose to impair yourself (situations of forced impairment are, of course, different). This is because though you might not have been in the right state to make a proper decision in that moment, you could have easily prevented it."

    "prompt": "I don't think blackface is racist as long as it is not used as a tool to ridicule. CMV.",
    "chosen": "Y'know, I used to think the way you think.  I agree that it's not immediately obvious why it needs to automatically be racist when white people dress up like black people for the purpose of playing a role.  \n\nBut then, I only knew about blackface from reading about it.  The thing that changed my view was seeing [a movie that portrayed actors wearing blackface](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034862/).  By which I mean, it was a movie *about actors*, and some of the time they wore blackface to do shows.  And holy fuck, that is some racist shit.  I think my favorite (by which I mean \"cringiest\") scene went something like this:  \n\nFemale lead, in her dressing room preparing for the show:  \"It's such a shame that I'll be wearing blackface tonight.  I so wanted to be beautiful for the audience.\"  \nMale lead, comfortingly:  \"Don't worry my dear, you've got the whole rest of your life to be captivatingly lovely.\"  \n\nYes, the racism is primarily because of how it was handled rather than anything inherent about white people portraying black characters, but now it rightly has racist associations for everyone who's been paying attention.  \n\nFurthermore, as long as racism is a real thing in the world, I think it's pretty hard for the \"privileged\" group to do the whole \"dress up as the unprivileged group for the purpose of acting!\" thing *without* bringing racism into the mix.  There are a couple main reasons for this:\n\n1.  This isn't a bank job--actors *do* get chosen for roles in part because of how they look.  Having people who look \"wrong\" for the part play the part anyway has the effect of disenfranchising black actors.  A white person wearing blackface doesn't really look as authentic as a legit black person, but if your default is to hire a white person for the job anyway, you're contributing to a systemic lack of job prospects for black people.  \n\n2.  If you mostly don't bother getting real black people to play your black characters, you're going to just end up entrenching racial stereotypes that may or may not be accurate.  It becomes a circlejerk of cluelessness and white privilege, because you've excluded anyone with the experience to potentially have a dissenting opinion.\n\nWeirdly enough, point 2 *also* only became obvious to me upon watching that movie I linked above.  The movie portrayed a bunch of (white) actors going around putting on shows, so when they showed one with a guy in blackface pretending to be a former slave, the racial stereotypes from the 1940's really popped out.  \n\nSo, let's say that now you come along wanting to use blackface in your movie because you couldn't find any black people for the part (though I imagine that you probably had *binders full of black people* to choose from).  You don't think it's racist because you don't think you're racist--it's just that the best person for the job happened to be white.  But guess what?  Nobody cares whether you think you're racist.  Blackface pretty much always ends up being bad for black people one way or another, and people are right to pick up on that.  \n\nWhite people, as a group, have collectively lost their \"using blackface without social repercussions\" privileges, because we've shown that we can't be responsible with it.  In a future society in which racism is no longer a thing, I expect that we'll all be able to go back to using blackface whenever we feel like it, because it won't automatically look like stinging mockery of an already disenfranchised group.

It can still cause real distress to potential victims, especially since most black people will be much more aware of the history of blackface.\n\nIf you think that causing this kind of distress is wrong (do you?) and you want to be consistent, you owe it to them to avoid any actions or speech that causes it."

    "prompt": "Philosophy has no tangible value as an academic field of study.",
    "chosen": "&gt;What do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection?\n\nTwo answers. #1 rigor and #2 it saves us from reinventing the wheel.\n\nWhen you ask the question of whether philosophy is useful, you give us an example of a practical application of philosophy. We're on the same page there. To expand on that, we face a lot of practical questions about what things have value. When we create school curricula we're making value judgments, when we allot budgets. These are, at least in one facet, philosophical questions, and important ones.\n\nBut you suggest we can answer these questions without studying philosophy. Can we answer high level economic questions without studying economics and math? Can we figure out plumbing questions without training in plumbing?\n\nThese value decisions (and value is just one kind of philosophical question we deal with constantly) can be based on valid or invalid arguments. If no one studies arguments of value, why do you believe that we can naturally recognize these with no study? Why do you think we should start from scratch in all value decisions rather than seeking to understand the work that has been done in the past?\n\nA lot of philosophy seems to be common sense just because it's been so thoroughly integrated into our culture. The place that we're currently at though is the result of a lot of work in ethics, epistemology and metaphysics. To assume we can arrive at the best answers just by thinking hard is ignoring the work that got us where we are, both in failing to understand how much labor was required to get us here, and failing to challenge some of our current baseline.\n\nNot everyone needs to study philosophy for their day to day lives, but everyone consumes it whether they know it or not. If no one studies it, then no one will be able to teach it. If no one is able to teach it, then everyone's philosophical positions will have no rigor, will make no use of the work that has already been done before.\n\nAll our philosophical questions then may as well be answered by /r/showerthoughts or /r/trees. Without rigor and background, that's where introspection gets you.",
    "rejected": "&gt; What do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection?\n\nAsk yourself the same question about math. Sure, with knowledge of basic numbers, we could theoretically use those numbers to derive all the theorems of geometry and calculus, reinvent fields like engineering, and create whole new mathematical principles simply by thinking about them, because math is a completely human invention. However, this is obviously foolish because countless geniuses have already made those discoveries; it makes much more sense to learn about what's already been discovered, even if (and especially if) you hope to make new discoveries yourself. And to assume that a person who knows very little about math could come up with those theories is, while strictly theoretically true, practically ridiculous.\n\nThe same goes for philosophy. Sure, you COULD use what you know about the world to independently come up with Wittgenstein's *Tractatus*, but I bet you won't, because to do so requires a monumental amount of existing philosophical knowledge that is impossible to figure out in a lifetime without some prior reference. So for the reason alone that it is virtually impossible to reach high levels of philosophy without first understanding the foundations, studying philosophy is a worthwhile endeavor because it gives the student access to knowledge that would have been highly arcane to them had they not studied the subject.\n\nBut your main argument seems to be that studying philosophy is a waste of time because it has no practical use. For one thing, the assumption that the only reason to study something is to major in that field is highly incorrect. Many people including myself leave college and never once use their major in the real world. Some use college as an opportunity to train for professional skills, others see it as a way to grow themselves as people and learn more about the world in general before getting a job and no longer having the opportunity. Both of these are worthwhile notions, and the very fact that people choose to study philosophy as opposed to more \"useful\" majors is proof that its existence is highly desirable at least to the people who are interested in it.\n\nThe biggest takeaway I get from your post is that you did not study philosophy, and you have somewhat of a misunderstanding of what it is. Many people who have never studied the subject believe to learn philosophy is to sit around shooting the shit about hypothetical questions and hackneyed moral quandaries. In actuality, my philosophical education (I minored in it but took as many classes in it as a major) involved tons of rigorous reading and papers, and included topics like AI theory, nature studies, and tort law. The books are extremely dense and, again, built on the backs of thousands of years of preceding philosophy, making it doubly important to study the subject in order to make that more advanced knowledge accessible.\n\nAt the end of the day, even if you don't buy most of those arguments, the fact remains that philosophy is worthwhile because there are people who see the value in taking it to expand their own horizons as well as change the way they view the world. Simply providing new modes of thought and analysis can alter the way you see everything else in the world, and in that sense, philosophy can actually be more transformative and helpful than any other subject."

It's really livestock that's so inefficient.\n\nAs to eggs and dairy, again these are fairly low compared to the consumption of beef.  A single cow can produce thousands of gallons of milk over her life, compared to the one-off steak frenzy that we get from slaughtering one.

It also has defense guns--not meant to be used like the aforementioned space ship lasers (that is, offensively), but rather meant to be used for defending the station from assault.

    "prompt": "I believe that Communism is not as bad as everyone says. CMV",
    "chosen": "&gt;A society where everyone is equal seems great to me\n\nThat's one of the big problems with communism - what is equality? Is everyone equal? Although I believe every human deserves equality in respect and dignity I don't believe everyone is equal. Will women receive the same opportunities in life as a man? Does a man with locked in-syndrome have the same opportunities as an Olympic athlete? Is it fair you may have a prettier wife than me? Life is unfair and financial equality is not the final answer.  \n\n&gt;it removes some of the basic faults in society, such as poverty, homelessness, joblessness, as well as touching on moral values such as greed, and envy\n\nYes there are problems within society but this doesn't mean there is a fault with society. Joblessness is just the growing pains of a changing society. With globalization and increase in women in work, there is much more people looking work than there was 60 years ago. We have always judged men on their ability to work now this has passed on to women and teenagers. Women who have children and do not work are stigmatized where as they were stigmatized if they did work 60 years ago. We pressure everyone in a family to be employed when one employed family member would suffice. Now I'm not saying women and teenagers should not work, I’m just saying the world is still adapting to this.\n\nHomelessness and poverty can be tackled through welfare reforms. Universal healthcare, free education, social care and strong welfare system can address these problems without the need for reformation of the system. To show this is working all we have to do is look back 100 years ago where one of the biggest health problems in the western world was malnutrition whereas now it is obesity.\n\n&gt;as well as touching on moral values such as greed, and envy\n\nThis is another big problem for communism; it doesn't take human nature into consideration. Sure people can be generous and thoughtful but they are also greedy, envious and selfish whether we see it or not. It is human instinct to put our own interests first. Many could help poverty right now by giving their disposable income to charity but they don’t. Communism too heavily depends on people doing the best for everyone else and when they don’t communism cannot function.\n\n&gt;I believe a proper Communist society (I.E. one that is not a dictatorship like Joseph Stalin or Fidel Castro)\n\nfurthermore, it is unlikely we could ever get a true communist society due to human nature. When you place a man in charge of a one party government which controls the means of production it’s quite difficult to restrain him from going power mad.  There is also the issue of the definition of a true communist society.\n\nThe communist manifesto reads a lot like a religious doctrine. It over simplifies complex subjects such as politics, history, criminology and economics then generalises the specifics, which leaves it open to individual interpretation. Stalin’s idea of communism was different to Lenin as was Castro’s to Mao’s and each of them found it imperative to supress individuality and human expression. \nThis is why the majority of communist states enacted a one party system. If the individual was allowed to express their ideas then they could find like-minded people, form an assembly then eventually a political party which could replace the communist state. In any given society there will always be people, who want to express their ideas, better their life’s and extend their liberties, so a democratic communist state would defiantly find political opposition.  In order to sustain a communist state you would have to revoke democracy and quash freedom of expression, therefore the smallest minority, the individual, would lose it rights and the state would determine what we needed and distribute it accordingly. \nThis then leads to the inequality of equality. If distribution was based on need, then people would   lose the incentive to improve themselves. If a rocket scientist received the same as a bin man what would be the point in wasting years training to be a rocket scientist? As all property would be owned by state the only way you could improve your life would be through the state. This would in turn lead to nepotism and put a restraint on human ambition and creativity. Entrepreneurs could no longer develop their own company, create art, make movies or write their own novels.  Could you imagine a world without Apple, McDonalds or Coca Cola?  Would you trade it all to stand for hours in a bread line? \nOverall, I believe communism is not the answer simply because people like to own things. Whether it’s their acres of land, their house, their car or the shirt on their back, people will always want their own property.  Giving up our property, our democratic system and our liberties is not the solution for society’s problems, a capitalist economy with socialist aspects that promotes free education universal healthcare, social care and a strong welfare system would help towards our goal of reducing society’s ailments. \n",
    "rejected": "Firstly, if you haven't done so already, I'd highly recommend reading *Animal Farm* by George Orwell. It is an allegory of the Russian Revolution that describes exactly why the idea of \"everyone is equal\" never works.\n\nCommunism always has and always will eventually lead to political repression, personality cults, loss of basic freedoms and inhibited economic and social development. There are enough examples throughout recent history that support this claim. \n\nSure, you could argue for a \"perfect\" communist state that wouldn't face these problems. But in theory, a perfect dictatorship would work just as well, so would perfect anarchy. While communism sounds good in theory, so does every other philosophy anyone has ever dreamed of. \n\nThe bottom line is, you cannot suppress basic human desires. It is in our nature to want \"more\". Capitalism incentives this desire, while communism crushes it. In communism, it is only the political class that has the means to get more, while most of society is living devoid of any incentive to succeed."

Strong libertarians will argue that the market will take care of this, but rather than see who dies of e coli and then boycotting the sources of the tainted food, proactive government monitoring makes sense to most people.\n\nTo use your paragliding example, there's a role in monitoring and punishing a company that claims to use a titanium frame but actually uses a more failure-prone aluminum frame.\n\nThe question is what happens when an inherently unsafe product is offered?  Should a company be able to market a paper airplane you strap to your back, which has a 100% failure rate?

It seems like plenty of people can function just fine and suffer relatively few side effects. They can still be functioning members of society.\n\nHowever, once we get to heavier drugs, society has an interest in their regulation. Drug abuse can be a [huge cost to society](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/addiction-science-molecules-to-managed-care/introduction/drug-abuse-costs-united-states-economy-hundreds-billions-dollars-in-increased-health) as a whole.

Our current drug laws also cause drug users to commit more crime and waste law enforcement resources.\n\nObviously, we need to change our drug laws. The question is, to what extent?\n\n2.) At the very least, we need to teach people about the negative effects of drug abuse without demonizing drug use or drug abusers. If we legalize harder drugs, we have to tax them heavily to make up for the cost to society. That is part of the reason I am ok with taxing cigarettes pretty heavily. The people who smoke should have to carry a lot of the cost for the loss of productivity and the health care costs. Similarly, if you want to use meth, cocaine, or heroine, you should have to pay a tax for all the negative side effects your actions have on society as a whole. \n\n\nPersonally, I don't care what people do with their own lives. If someone wants to screw up their life with drug abuse, that is on them.\n\nBut I also feel a certain responsibility to educate people on why drug abuse is a concern and how it can ruin lives. This isn't just about illicit drugs, though. I'm pretty sure that prescription drug abuse is a lot more rampant. People need to know that abusing oxycodone or hydrocodone can kill you, especially if alcohol is involved.\n\n\n**TLDR**: The government has a vested interest in making sure individuals aren't a drain on the economy.

You're right, there are some distinct differences between the brains of men and women. [And recent research has shown that, in many of the cases they've been able to study, pre-transition transgender individuals' brains are already structurally more similar to the gender they want to transition to than the gender they were born as/assigned.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure) What you're pointing at as proof that transgender individuals are \"in denial\" is arguably evidence of the opposite.",

I would even argue that as society becomes more tolerant, some gay men who *would* be told off if they were women or straight men are immune from being told they're whiny attention whores because nobody wants to be labeled a homophobe (note: I AM NOT SAYING all or even most gay men are like this, I'm talking about the extreme ones).

The point is that gay people should be free to express their sexuality in more or less the same way straight people can, which involves being pretty damn effeminate for some.

    "prompt": "Refusing to presumptively believe an accuser of rape (or any other crime) is a) NOT equivalent to presumptively disbelieving her and b) the proper course to take in the absence of further evidence.",
    "chosen": "&gt; It seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate \"not believing one's story\" with \"disbelieving one's story\", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite—but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. \n\nThis is my fundamental issue with your argument. While in real life \"truth\" is not black and white, believing someone is. Do you really think that the victim of a trauma (rape) is going to hear you saying \"I don't believe you, but I also don't DISbelieve you\" and walk away feeling like he or she was heard and understood? I doubt it. I wouldn't. If you don't believe someone, then you disbelieve them. \n\nImagine a victim of another \"emotional\" and hard to prove crime. Imagine someone came to you and said \"Someone is stalking me. They keep calling and when I answer the phone, they are breathing into it heavily or they just hang up. I hear tapping on my window at night. I've set up a surveillance camera and I can't catch them on tape.\" While that story *could* be proven to be a lie, it's unlikely that you would say to your friend, who is freaked out and confiding in you, \"I hear your story, and I'm just going to wait until you have some evidence to really believe you\". While that may be the logical, sensical way to respond to it, that does nothing to ease the emotional damage that has been done. You're essentially saying \"I don't really believe you\" to someone who is in a highly emotional state.\n\nI don't disagree that rapes accusations should not be made in public unless there is hard evidence. If someone's name is going to go on the record, if it's going to affect their life, then those accused of rape deserve to have evidence presented against them, not just someone's word. But, in the rape debate, I feel like people forget that being accused of *any crime* ruins someone's life. Think about people who are accused of child abuse, murder, even theft. If your employer gets wind that you're the prime suspect in a murder investigation, you bet your ass there are going to be consequences. So your argument isn't necessarily about rape, it's about an accusation of crime at all. No one is \"innocent until proven guilty\". For an extreme example, look at OJ or Casey Anthony. Stop by /r/serialpodcast and check out the debates people get in over a man who was convicted of murder 15 years ago. I would say that grey area is just an inherent part of our legal system. \n\nTo tip my hand a little, I am a woman in her late 20s who was sexually assaulted in college. I knew my assailant-- I worked with him-- and my assault was one of those messy instances where, as a victim, I didn't do the *right* thing. I was drinking underage, I trusted someone that others perceived as \"shady\", I was very friendly and kind to him which \"gave him the wrong idea\". I know in my heart that I was assaulted. I had to quit my job because when he inevitably got fired, everyone in my workplace *blamed* me, started rumors about my sexual activity, and all-around implied (or sometimes, said outright) that I was lying. \n\nMy sexual history is the sole reason I did not go to the police. I knew that if I was going to be \"put on trial\", so to speak, at my place of employment, then an investigation would just dig up all of the skeletons that I hid away for a reason. \n\nI told that story because the social/cultural pressures and forces that surround rape cases are a *major* part of why women push for every rape accuser to be believed immediately. Because it is so easy to brush rape off, to read a radical feminist's post on tumblr about how \"all sex is rape\" and internalize the fact that, if women really wanted to, they could avoid most rape-y situations. Yes, I personally could have done things to avoid my rape. I made bad choices. But does that make my assailant's decision to rape me any *less* bad? \n\nIn our public's eyes, it comes off that way. When we can avoid putting the victim's life on trial, when we can as a society view rape for what it is (an act of power and aggression, not sexual desire), I think we can move forward and have a more easily received conversation about false rape accusations. But our culture and national conversation stands, and you can't ignore that piece of it in my mind. ",
    "rejected": "Here's my take:\n\n&gt;A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage and/or punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other.\n\nYou state multiple times that the default position is to believe no assertion without evidence.  That's clearly level-headed and baldly obvious.  It can get tricky, though.  Let's run through some situations.\n\n* Man A informs you that God sent down his only Son Jesus Christ as your lord and Savior.\n\n* Man B informs you that Jesus was sent down, but was not God's son, and that Muhammad is God's prophet and bring's God's word.\n\n* You, not presumptively believing either of them, choose not to convert to either religion and remain a Pastafarian open to future conversion\n\nSo far so good.  These were two un-evidenced assertions and you chose to believe neither of them.  You maintained your original position of absurd parody religion/nonbelief, but did so without prejudice against future attempts by Man A or Man B.\n\nThis situation represent a clear demonstration of the non-presumption principle (as we have named it just now).\n\nNow for a harder one:\n\n* Man A informs you that God sent down his only Son Jesus Christ as your lord and Savior.\n\n* Man B says \"That's not true.\"\n\n* You, not presumptively believing either of them, choose not to convert to Christianity and remain a Pastafarian open to future conversion.\n\nIn this case, your inaction is non-neutral.  The two sides have encompassed the entire available logical market and you have no choice but to be in accord with one of them.  You either believe that Christ died for your sins, or you don't.  There are huge ranges of individuation available within each camp, but the entire world, ultimately, falls into one camp of the other.  Even rocks can be safely categorized as \"things that do not believe Christ died for their sins.\"\n\nThis is where the problem with the way rapes are handled comes from.  We have an accuser and a denier.  These two positions occupy the entire logical maketplace.  Either you believe this happened, or you do not.  A position of skepticism is just a finer point that fills within the non-belief camp.  Of course, that's okay.  Investigators must move with skepticism, but there is a further problem.\n\nUnlike our good friends Man A and Man B, your choice is not simply a choice about yourself.  If you incorrectly fall into the wrong initial starting position, you are not only affecting yourself.  As a reporter, investigator, police officer, judge, juror, school administrator, or gossiping student your actions cannot be rendered neutral in this kind of case.  Your skeptical behavior is intrinsically damaging to the rape victim and helpful to the rapist - OR - damaging to the false-accuser and helpful to the falsely-accused.\n\nDoing nothing following a rape accusation is guaranteed to victimize whichever person is the victim and play into the hands of whichever person is the aggressor.  I disagree with your statement that we have no idea how common false accusations are - I understand that they are much rarer than real accusations, but that is not my chosen point of contention with you - but even in a world in which the division were 50-50 (perhaps we agree that this is an absurd world) it is unconscionable to maintain a situation in which either a rapist and victim, or a slanderer and victim, should be forced to continue attending classes in t he same building.  In such a situation it will be the innocent party who is living under greater duress and who will crumble under social pressure first, assuring nearly-universal wins for the aggressor.\n\nInaction is not a neutral act in this kind of case, and so the non-presumptive principle remains good for withholding judgment, but utterly fails to prescribe responsible actions.\n\nEven a coin-flip to determine initial presumptive positions for the purpose of early action would be preferable to a default inaction in terms of the expected return in outcomes."

This is simply another overblown moral panic, children know participation trophies are utterly meaningless. The only people who give a damn about them are the few parents who think their kids will be devastated if they don't get a trophy and the current generation of zealots who are obsessed with their duty to decry obvious moral decay and are absolutely certain that *this* is truly the herald of societal decline (ignore the warnings from all previous generations). \n\nEvery generation is convinced that the next one is taking us down the shitter, surely you remember the Rock and Roll panic?

Secondly (at least in my experience) even though everyone gets a trophy, only certain trophies will say \"Champion\" or \"Third Place.\"  So the winners do get something differently.  Finally for those who try very hard in sports victory would be it's own reword.  Kids who really care about winning would do anything to win and the fact that the people they beat get some cheap plastic doesn't kill their drive.  It might coddle the losers in sports but, in my honest opinion, sports don't reflect other parts of society and the naturally talented athletes won't lose their motivation.  I'd also like to point out that the idea of 1st-3rd is just defined by our culture.  I mean what is second place besides a glorified participation trophy.

In fact, they have strong incentive not to, because they need to stay impartial. A defense attorney has no divided loyalty, he wants to make sure that his clients rights are protected, so he will zealously investigate the state's conduct.\n\n2. Ensure that the accused is able to bring forward all relevant evidence. This is also not something a judge can do, because it requires someone who is an advocate for the accused. Most people accused of a crime do not know what is or is not a relevant defense. They may not understand what's going on. There defense may require investigation to prove, witnesses may need to be tracked down. A judge cannot be expected to determine when that's worthwhile or not.",

    "chosen": "I think its important to remember when reviewing history, that we not use modern notions of morality and hindsight to judge the actions of those in the past without understanding the context those decisions were made, which includes the morals and norms of the day, and the physical evidence they had available.\n\nEvery time the atomic bombs are mentioned, it seems like people keep bringing up the same arguments about how the atomic bombs were unnecessary. About how these were intended to kill civilians and were unnecessary since Japan was going to surrender anyways.\n\nNone of these, however, take into account what the decision makers had to deal with at the time, nor do they take into account the facts about Japan's situation at the time.\n\nThe whole talk about how the bombs were unnecessary and that Japan was seeking to surrender forgets that Japan didn't surrender despite given multiple chances. On July 26th, the Allies in Europe already issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding Japan's immediate and unconditional surrender - something the Allies wanted to ensure they could never have a repeat of Germany's rise after WWI which caused WWII. Two of the points here:\n\n&gt;Point 10: We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.\n&gt;\n&gt;Point 13: We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.\n\nNot only did the Japanese refuse this unconditional surrender, but Japan thought it could broker a peace with the US through the Soviet Union which was already preparing its invasion of Japan, to honor its agreement to declare war on Japan within 100 days of its victory over Germany.\n\nIn addition, the power struggle in Japan's government means that civilian government overtures to the Americans held little weight. The Japanese military government was the de facto power in Japan and often overruled the civilian government.\n\nFurthermore, the civilian government simply wasn't trusted by the US or any Allied nations. The Americans remembered that on the afternoon of December 7, Japanese diplomat Kurusu delivered Japan's reply closing with the statement that \"The immutable policy of Japan is to promote world peace.\" He didn't know, due to the lag in communications, that at that moment, the bombing of Pearl Harbor had already commenced. What diplomatic integrity did Japan have in the eyes of the nations they had attacked at that point?\n\nAerial and naval reconnaissance of the Japanese home islands showed that the Japanese were digging in and preparing for an invasion. These diplomatic overtures were often seen as just stall tactics in order to better fortify the Japanese home islands to make an invasion less appealing, and thus give better terms for a brokered peace, which was the last thing the Allies wanted. In fact, the Allies knew that Japan had tried that strategy before – the whole point of the attack on Pearl Harbor was to buy time for the Japanese to implement their defenses in the Pacific in the hopes that it would make an American counter-offensive unpalatable. \n\nSpeaking of an invasion, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, was planned to commence in less than 100 days. The pre-invasion aerial and naval bombardment was scheduled for late October, and Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu was set for X-Day, November 1st. \n\nThe estimates for the death toll of an invasion of Japan were tremendous. This isn't some post-war revisionist estimates either - the military had estimated casualties based on the ever-rising death toll as the US got closer to the Japanese home islands. On Iwo Jima, for instance, only 216 of the 21,000 Japanese defenders surrendered. The US suffered over 6,700 killed and another 20,000 wounded in 35 days of fighting for *8 square miles* of island.\n\nOkinawa was even more horrendous - over 12,000 Americans were killed, another 55,000 wounded, and 38 ships lost in just 88 days of fighting. The Japanese suffered even more - over 77,000 killed with another 100,000+ civilians killed on those islands. That’s estimated to be a third of the civilian population of Okinawa. Now extrapolate that Kyushu, with its much higher population and highly populated cities (urban combat is notoriously deadly - over 200,000 were killed in 16 days in the Battle of Berlin), and any estimate is going to start in the hundreds of thousands killed.\n\nThe alternative to an invasion, of course, was to blockade Japan and starve its people to death. This would take time - and would ultimately have killed even more Japanese than the bombings would have, as history’s famines have shown time and again. Famine isn’t just discriminate – it disproportionately targets the weak, elderly, and young who would die first. Likewise, with food rations given to soldiers as a priority, civilians would have been disproportionately affected even further.\n\nThus, the atomic bombs were to be part of the series of aerial bombardment raids designed to cripple Japan's ability to fight and hopefully force a surrender before the invasion was necessary. The US had already done firebombing, such as the raid over Tokyo which killed more people than the atomic bombs did, as part of this same strategic bombing campaign.\n\nThe atomic bombs were thus viewed as a new and more efficient way to carry out the campaign. Keep in mind that all the negative focus on nuclear weapons of today is borne entirely out of our experience with nuclear weapons from these bombings AND from the decades of the Cold War. The very concept of nuclear weapons being unfathomable to use in war didn’t exist in 1945, and one could argue, largely came about precisely because these weapons were used.\n\nAnd for all the people that say the US wanted to kill indiscriminately, the fact is, the US dropped leaflets on over 30 cities in Japan in the weeks and months before the atomic bombings, warning Japanese civilians to evacuate their cities. They even very specifically mention that they are not targeting civilians, but the installations and workshops and factories of war.\n\nThe Japanese text on the reverse side of one of the leaflets dropped carried the following warning:\n\n&gt; “Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. \n&gt;\n&gt;But, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace which America will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan. \n&gt;\n&gt;You can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.”\n\nChilling to read those words, even today.\n\nThe bombing of Hiroshima, however, was met with silence from the Japanese. As thus, the US proceeded again with the bombing of Nagasaki. Why a second one? \n\nSimply because that was part of the strategy laid out to get Japan to surrender - the US would use atomic bombs as they were manufactured and became available. Keep in mind that during this time, the US could not mass-produce atomic weapons like it ended up being capable of doing in the Cold War. The centrifuges simply weren't up to the quality and ability of years later, and so early on, they were only able to manufacture one or two bombs a month. Nagasaki was the second and last of the bombs available – the next one wouldn’t be ready for use for more another week with planners estimating the US having only 7 total available by the time of X-Day.\n\nThus it wasn't about dropping a second bomb to be punitive – it was dropped because a second one was available. In other words, the plan was to eventually use the bombs continually until Japan surrendered or the invasion began in which case the bombs would then continue to fall in direct support of the troops until Japanese capitulation.\n\nAnd still, even with the Soviet entry into the war against Japan, there was silence and even resistance to surrender. An attempted coup against the Japanese emperor was tried but failed, and the Emperor made his famous broadcast to the Japanese people declaring his decision to surrender. In it, he very specifically mentions the atomic bombs, to which I conclude:\n\n&gt;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\n",
    "rejected": "&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.\n\nThe other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.\n\n[Japan was in no mood to surrender prior to this, or even after the first bombing.](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/)\n\n&gt; If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.\n\nYOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.\n\nHiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.\n\n&gt; Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.\n\nApples and oranges to compare Al-Qaeda, a rogue terrorist organization and total war between nations.\n\n[Everybody was attacking civilian targets in WW2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II).  When nations go to war, that is what happens.\n\n&gt; The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared.\n\nYou have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.\n\nThe Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)\n\n&gt; “Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”\n\nAnd despite all that, they still refused to surrender. At some point, you have to acknowledge that the Japanese have culpability for some of this as well.\n\n[To single out the atomic bombings as some kind of extra-inhumane effort on behalf of the USA, is little odd, given that our conventional air raids did much more damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan)"

The official purpose of this was to guarantee that lineage would be easily traceable (for the purpose of making it easir to discriminate against people of Jewish ancestry even if they looked Iberian).\n\nSo, here's how it goes.  When you get married, your name does not change at all.  Juan Carlos marries Maria Sanchez and those are their names.  Their child is named \"Julio Carlos Sanchez.\"\n\nLittle Julio meets the love of his life, Ana Ramirez Velasquez.  Their child is named Elvira Carlos Ramirez Sanchez Velasquez (names intertwined, rather than stacked).\n\nSo, you might imagine that this gets out of hand rapidly?  You would be right, but there are a few mitigating circumstances.  First: no birth certificates or other documentation existed for the bulk of people for the bulk of this time.  Names were only ever really used in their full form for marriages and baptisms.\n\nNow, enter the modern paperwork state:\n\nIn Spain, your legal names contains up to your first four family names.  All further names exist only in private or church records and are not part of your formal, state identity except where useful to distinguish between otherwise identically-named people.  Essentially, family names are simply truncated on official paperwork and the true length of the names drops off into obscurity with the same depressing speed with which you lost track of the name of your great-great grandfather.\n\nDo you know who your great-great grandfather was?  Neither do Spaniards, long names be damned.\n\n-----\n\nSO\n\nNames will always err on the side of practicality, and hyphenated name conventions will not survive across multiple generations except as a ritual.

    "chosen": "Pointing out privilege is like a well made sledgehammer.  It's a tool and can be used very effectively but there are a lot of idiots out there flailing madly with a bigass hammer.  Reminding a person of their privilege is supposed to remind people that sometimes your status in life can make it difficult to understand what another group is going through and make you pause and try to make sure that you aren't being inconsiderate of another person's situation.  For example, white people sometimes say things about \"Well if I was black I'd xyz\" but the truth is that they are speaking from a position of being born into a society with certain advantages and don't have personal experience with what it is like to grow up black.  White people often don't appreciate the fact that many young black men grow up around a certain culture of drugs or gang violence due to where they live and their parents' level of income and from their perspective those things were a part of life and something everyone they knew got involved in.  So that's what is meant by \"white privilege\".  It means that as a white person I have to be careful that I don't let my experience of life dictate how I view the lives of others.  I have male privilege as well so when it comes to women's issues I need to be careful that I take the time to try and understand the other position.  So I don't think that the use of \"privilege\" statements is inherently wrong, but it must be done carefully.

No!\n\n&gt;Given an infinite amount of time, if there is the possibility that something will occur, it will eventually occur.*\n\nNo no no, that's not how probability *or* infinite sets work.\n\nExample: Suppose I have a bag with infinitely many integers inside, and infinite time. Each hour, you pull an integer from the bag. For any integer you can think of, there is a possibility that you will pull it from the bag. *But* that doesn't mean you will. Instead you could pull 2 on the first hour, 4 on the second, 6 on the third, etc etc pulling even numbers each time. You never run out because there are *also* infinitely many even numbers, so in this scenario you never draw the number 1. It was possible to draw, but it didn't *have* to be drawn.\n\nThis isn't even mentioning the fact that there is more than one 'size\" of infinity. The real numbers are infinite of at least an order larger than the integers (and so are called \"uncountable\" to contrast our ability to count integers). If you had a box the size of the integers, you could *never* fit all the real numbers into it at once!\n\nSuppose you pick a random real number between 0 and 1 in decimal expansion, i.e. you pick a random infinite decimal such as 0.12500... or 0.333... . (This is the same as picking infinitely many digits). 2 is a possible digit, but 0.333... doesn't have 2 as a digit!\n\nJust because something is possible, doesn't mean it will occur *even in infinite time*. An example better fit for your problem: It is possible that, given infinite time, I will choose to eat chocolate ice cream after dinner. But maybe I just decide on vanilla every night. I could eat vanilla ice cream after dinner every night ad infinitum. The event of me eating chocolate ice cream would then never have occured, despite it being possible.",

Who is to say the extremely improbable (approaching zero) probability this occurs for every being in heaven is not possibly going to be the case? It'd be pretty ridiculous, but yet still actually possible. Infinity and probability are strange things, and perhaps this insanely unlikely outcome occurs for every person who makes it into heaven; it could theoretically happen, and there would be no issue with \"free will\" being violated here. \"6\" is certainly not true even if the only condition needed for sin to occur is the individual ability to choose; it's just very likely to be the case.\n\nWith that said, I would suggest it's entirely possible to have \"free will\" and yet be incapable of choosing to sin. \"Free will\" is about having a free choice, and you can have a free choice between two \"good\" options without a \"bad\" counterbalance of any kind. Saying that you must also be free to pick an sufficiently bad option if you have a choice is probably wrong; you can totally have a choice, even a free choice, between various forms of exercise without including \"stabbing someone to death\" as a possible exercise choice (let's say, in a reality where that's physically impossible).\n\nOne example would be that you have an infinite number of choices, but none of them involve sin. Even if you have a finite number of choices, and you can freely choose, and none of them involves sin, is this not still \"free will\"? And of course, an omnipotent being could create a world with \"free will\", but where one cannot sin; it could shape every facet of reality such that only certain actions were possible / such that certain actions were not possible."

For example, the obesity-related medical need could be ongoing mobility assistance, while the sports one could be someone thrown from a horse with multiple fractures, possible brain damage and major reconstructive surgery.\n\nPost-procedure, the amount of tax the person pays into the system will change how much their procedure costs; the obese person may recover from their surgery and go back to their job in the top income bracket, while the sports-player might have been a student who was going to become a professional but now can't and instead goes into retail and earns minimum wage.\n\nThen of course there is the cost of NOT doing the procedure.

If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to break them down a bit so I can talk about them a bit more specifically.\n\n\n**1) That people getting offended here are so being they are latent homophobes**\n\nI think this is more an outcry of how homophobic the use of the \"I AM GAY\" thing is and/or how unprofessional it is. It's not so much of a \"Someone called you *gaaaay*? That must have hurt you so much!\" but \"Someone called you gay, what an unprofessional douche!\"\nAlso, I think a lot of the embarrassment that the man felt here is this would have been extremely tacky or strange for a gay person to do to their luggage. If I was gay, I'd be embarrassed if someone did that to my luggage, even it was true. I'd have to carry this giant, attention grabbing sign saying \"I AM GAY\" past hundreds of onlookers who have no reason to think I wouldn't have put it on myself as some sort of cry for attention.\n\n**2) A straight person being called gay should garner the same reaction as a black person being called white.**\n\nAs far as JUST the issue of being offended by being gay compared to being offended by being black, being black is something you can see right away. If someone called a white person black, no one would believe them, there would be literally no way to prove it right. With being gay, there are no instantly indicating factors. If all gay people had blue skin, I doubt anyone would ever call anyone gay as an insult who didn't have blue skin.\n\nAlso, as a side note, many black people who have light skin *hate* being called white, either as an insult or an innocent mislabeling, and I doubt they are racist.\n\n**3) That a straight person being offended at being called gay is a sign of latent homophobia.**\n\nAlthough I believe this *can* be true, I don't think it's *always* true. I think a lot of it is just that people don't like having their sexuality, something that only they can know and has played a large portion in their life, openly questioned. For instance, I've had bisexual friends who have both been told \"Oh you're just fully gay, admit it\" or \"You're not actually gay, you're just straight and pretending\" (or something along those lines). They obviously had no problem with gay or straight people, but it's just straight up incorrect and it bugs them when people say it.\n\nI've also had transgender friends, and it really annoys them when they get misgendered. Like in the situation of calling a transwoman \"sir\" by accident, they have nothing against men but it just really bugs them being sincerely called something they know they're not. It's part of their self identification, and it's a pain in the ass to have that challenged or ignored. ",
    "rejected": "I believe that sexual identification is \"deeper\" (no pun intended) than racial or ethnic identity. \n\nFor instance, I am American. It is because of where I was born and defines me to some extent but I can choose that extent. I would be annoyed or confused if someone called me British but being American is not a fundamental part of my innermost identity as a person, not a member of society. \n\nHowever being straight is a large part of my identity. I think about it when I wake up, when I see men, when I look at girls and when I go to sleep. It is fundamental to who I am, so asserting that I am not heterosexual is thus a more pertinent and important issue. Not only that but like many straight people I find the concept of gay sex abhorrent. This doesn't mean I have in irresistable urge to stab any gay person I meet but I would not watch and being forced to take part would be a form of mild to moderate torture. I don't want anyone confusing me with a person who would enjoy that\n\nAnother thing is that orientation is not obvious. You can tell if someone is a man or a woman by looking at them and deduce their race pretty quickly by looking at them too. However you can't (usually) visually be certain of whether someone is or not, so if someone said I was gay, the rumor mill would be much harder to stop so gay rumors are much more likely to cause personal damage\n\nOn another note this could be viewed as a pro-gay rights reaction. The airline person used gay as an insult, so part of the negative reaction would be the fact that someone was using the word and grouping as an insult. A gay person would also react negatively against this I would suspect, arguing that they should be treated normally as not as an exotic abnormality. "

Clearly a blanket \"lying is *always* wrong\" is not correct, but a Kantian can account for this by just making a more complicated maxim: \"you should never lie unless it is for the greater good\". In that case you are making more specific rules for more specific scenarios out of concern for the consequences of your action.

    "chosen": "I'm not going to try to fully address your points as I think there is good discussion going on there already, but I'd like to offer some counter points from personal experience. I'm a working director in television &amp; commercials, and I also do a lot of web video and sometimes short films. I'm not in any way a leader in the field of filmmaking, but I have a dozen years of experience in this industry and I think enough perspective to speak on issues of \"what matters\" to a film generally. \n\nSo anyways, my point - I think you have it backwards. A good actor can make a script, production, editor, etc look good. And a bad actor can bring down the best of everything. And I've worked with a *lot* of bad actors. \n\nI'm a tech guy - I did VFX for years, I build my own post production hardware, I'm a camera nerd and can gossip ad nauseum about sensor charts. I like engineering and the structured mindset of editing. But I know the limits of cameras, set design, effects, color and what they *can't* bring to a film.\n\nEven the lowest paid grip on set can tell when a good actor is \"on.\" They can make scenes work that just shouldn't (and there are plenty of those floating around out there). Having a quality actor on set gives you options as a filmmaker, because they can adapt, give you new ideas, play a scene big to fill a room you didn't have the budget to set dress, play it close to let you cover with a closeup for a matching action you couldn't get yesterday, solve a script problem with a look or a physical affectation, the list goes on and on. \n\nI'm rambling, but this is it - as a low-tier professional filmmaker who usually has a budget handed down to him, there is no camera, light, location support or extra asset worth more to me than a good actor. I can say this definitively because usually talent is the *first* thing cut from my budgets (because you are not the first person with this idea - and business people don't like things that can't be quantified), so I have more than enough experience with bad or mediocre acting and what it can do to a production. \n\n**TL;DR:** A bad actor will paint you into a corner as a filmmaker, a good actor will set you free and help you make the best film possible.",
    "rejected": "I think there is definitely a major impact on an actor's performance when given a good script and good direction, but there is also a skill to the actor themselves and they way in which they go about their work.\n\nA good actor will try to understand the character and their motivations, and will give feedback to the writers and director about how a line feels and sounds in that context. Also, a huge thing about great actors for television and films is their ability to self-choreograph otherwise improvised motions. Something as simple as how they hold a prop like a cigarette or a drink, and the timing of when they take a sip in the dialogue, and making that consistent goes a long way to making the editor's life a hell of a lot easier when editing for continuity. A lot of novice actors will move around at random, just reading the lines and trying to act as it comes to them. When you take the footage back to edit, it can often be a mess trying to line up shots where the actor's arms or legs are in the same position at the same word in a dialogue, and you end up having to edit around them instead of editing around how it would feel best. \n\nBut of course, any production is a culmination of all its constituent parts.

And therefore I think we should ban gay sex.\n\nWhat's really the important issue here. That my position is motivated by religion? Or that my position was factually inaccurate? To me, as an atheist, I actually don't care what the motivation for your belief is, whether it be religious or secular. I care about 2 things, in a very very simplified model:\n\n1) Do I agree with the goal you are trying to achieve?\n\n2) If so, do I agree that the means you advocate achieves that goal?\n\nTaking the example above, I do agree that drought is bad. So we've passed step 1. But I don't agree that banning gay sex will alleviate the drought. Whether or not your belief that doing so comes from religious or secular just doesn't seem relevant.\n\nMake sense?",
    "rejected": "I am not entirely sure what view you are attempting to have changed here. Either \"my religion states that drinking is wrong so for that reason I am fighting to make alcohol illegal\" is what you take issue with, or \"my religion states drinking is wrong, and it is more virtuous to abstain from drinking when temptation is all around you than to abstain when abstinence has been made the default legal option\".\n\nThe first one which is often tied to another topic which I don't want to start a debate about, could be construed in a few different ways. If drinking is such a reprehensible act and the ills it causes society are immeasurably horrific according to your religion, then doing everything in your power to prevent it from happening (in this case enacting legislation) could be considered moral and desirable. Further, if there are people who do not subscribe to your religion that take part in such a sinful exercise, while you may not be converting them to your religion (which is often the ultimate goal) you are at least preventing them from doing something that you view as wrong. \n\nLet's say we did live in a world where murder really was perfectly acceptable, but religion decided it isn't as great as everyone else thinks it is. If religion cannot convert everyone to that religion and their beliefs, would it not be at least a partial win for them to use \"secular\" powers for them to prevent murder? Would it not be dutiful/righteous of you and your religion to try to prevent everyone else from doing things you believe to be wrong?\n\nFor the second \"without temptation, abstinence is meaningless\" argument, people who have a religious conviction to avoid something typically put a great deal of effort into avoiding situations where they would encounter temptation. While alcohol may be freely available in some parts of the world, most people who have made a religious decision to avoid it do not keep it in the house to test their temptation. In largely religious communities/jurisdictions, it might not be commercially available, or at least you have to go out of your way to find it. They probably don't find themselves at craft beer festivals, taking winery tours, going to dollar pint night etc. all that frequently either. So while they might not be fighting for prohibition to be reenacted, they aren't actively seeking out alcohol in order to not drink it, and I doubt it would be considered good or righteous for them to be doing so. \n\nAre you suggesting that \"true believers\" would/should be testing their beliefs by regularly encountering temptation? Is that the best way to prove your faith?\n\nPersonally, I believe that if someone has a religious conviction against something then they are welcomed to believe that, but they should be accepting that others do not share their faith and thus their beliefs. That concept runs completely against most religions, as they tend to have some sort of \"share the good word\" or \"make others believe\" clause in there somewhere, but whether or not religion is a good or bad thing is not the topic of this CMV.

The laws are suppose to be written so that any company that is caught breaking the law will face consequences that far outweigh the benefits gained from breaking said law.  Unfortunately this is not how is works in the real world.\n\nOne thing to realize, is that the person who makes the decision to break the law can be held criminally and financially responsible for the crime.  Again, in the real world, this isn't always the case, but it is enough to remove the fiduciary duty.\n\nWhen doing a cost benefit analysis you always need to factor in the risk of something occurring, in this case getting caught.  Breaking the law may be profitable if a company can get away with it for a year, but what are the chances of getting caught in the first year, or even first month?\n\nAnd let's not forget that the costs aren't always simply paying a fine, it may include restitution, punitive damages, criminal charges, loss of enrichment, and loss of public goodwill. \n\nSo let's make up an example.\n\nLet's say you run a company that makes rims for cars.  You sell both to the after market and directly to the manufacturers.  \n\nOne day you come up with a scheme to import cheap aluminium from North Korea.  You do the math, and by importing from North Korea, you will save $5 million a year.  You also look into the fine, and it's only $500,000.  \n\nSo let's say you make it one full year before you are caught.  Right away the government slaps you with the fine.  Then when word gets out, all of the manufacturers drop you, and take you to court for the unjust enrichment of selling them North Korean aluminium and on top of that, the after market shops don't want to deal with you, unless you drop your prices significantly.  And there still could be criminal charges for doing business with an enemy of America. \n\nOn top of this, the share price drops, because many people don't want to hold stock in a company that deals with North Korea.\n\nSo not only have you fucked over the share holders, you have also put yourself at risk of losing your freedom.\n\nThis was a very simple example.  There are many other cases where breaking the law can have some much more serious drawbacks, like manslaughter charges, loss of the ability to do business, major environmental clean ups,  or even violence against the company.\n\nThe laws should be written in a way, and enforcement should be adequate, that breaking the law is clearly not in the best interest of the share holders, and would not be the fiduciary duty of the executives.

But what about the negative publicity they are receiving, what about the possible thousands of consumers that will be turned away from their products in this and coming years because they feel they cannot trust the manufacturer. This is a logical thing for a customer to include in his/her consideration of what automobile to buy. Why, then, would a corporation not include this in its cost-benefit analysis?\n\nWhat I'm saying is, the consequences of breaking the law/doing the \"wrong\" thing are not always strictly fine-based. Company reputation matters, and may tilt the scales in favor of good behavior in some/many cases."

Battles are fun and the stories can be entertaining, but I personally wouldn't argue that these are what have led the series to its immense, international popularity. \n\nI would say some of the strongest points of the series are the following:\n\n* The joys and wonders of finding new Pokemon: This appeals to so many things that people find enjoyable: adventure, discovery, exploration, collecting. Even after having encountered all the species of Pokemon that exist in the game, people still have fun searching for Pokemon with certain stats. attributes, genders, or colors. Because of how rare and difficult to obtain some of these Pokemon are, trainers always have new adventures that they get to undertake in the form of hunting these more elusive creatures.\n* Virtual Pets: Unlike other RPG's where you are taking control of humans, in Pokemon you get to control a team of cool, cute, funny, lovable monsters! Pokemon, in a sense, gives you the opportunity to have those dogs, cats, birds, and hamsters that you've always wanted, but never had because either your parents wouldn't let you, you don't want to put up with the hassle of taking care of them, or you just don't trust yourself with a real living creature. Except in Pokemon, those pets breath fire, shoot streams of pressurized water, and hurl bolts of lightning at each other, all at your command.\n\nSo I would just say that it isn't valid to say Pokemon has no appeal because it is lacking in what are admittedly its weakest aspects. Every game is lacking in some way or another, but what makes it fun is how well its strong points make up for this.",
    "rejected": "Grinding and strategy aside, Pokemon was an insanely addicting and fun game. It's appeal wasn't just that it was a great game, but that it was a blockbuster experience.\n\n1. Popularity. Almost every kid in school played it. You could trade with them, and battle against them, and best of all, you could talk shop with them. It was an easy way to make friends.\n\n2. Pacing. The game was set up such that you were always just good enough to beat the next boss by the time you faced them. This meant that you didn't have to outright grind to beat bosses, but that you weren't too good either. This kept the focus on strategy instead of grinding. It was a simple strategy, but hey, I was in elementary school.\n\n3. The game had the achievable, but still difficult goal of collecting every single Pokemon. Combined with the main story, this game could take people 50-100 hours of straight gameplay to beat. The battles weren't even the main part of the game. It was more about beating puzzles and collecting Pokemon, which made grinding and boss battles less important. By the end, I would often use \"repel\" just to avoid fighting random Pokemon (aka grinding) so that I could continue the puzzles and hunt for new Pokemon.\n\n4. The game featured extremely addicting elements. This included the fun of raising adorable virtual pets (the game came out shortly after the Tamagotchi phenomenon.) It also included the element of chance. Finding Pokemon was often random, but was totally doable if you invested enough time. Every single Pokemon fight offered a chance to catch something new (at least until you found out what the Pokemon was.) It activated the same neural pathways as gambling in a casino. Hell, the game even featured a virtual token casino. If you add in a compelling story, and the drive to \"catch 'em all, you basically end up with crack for ten year olds.\n\n3. It was a cultural phenomenon. The story was great, and it was supported by TV shows, movies, and a ton of additional media such as playing cards. There were tons of magazine covers and articles devoted to the Pokemon fad. The game was a big deal, and it felt like it.\n\nPersonally, I don't really see the appeal of playing Pokemon anymore, but I am way to old to be a part of their target audience. I still have a ton of nostalgia for Red and Blue though. That being said, while the initial hype has died down, the game has somehow stuck around. People still play them and have fun. Overall, Red and Blue were two of the best games I've ever played, and I think that even if people found the grinding and battle strategy a bit annoying sometimes, the rest of the game more than made up for it."

    "prompt": "I believe adopting a single, unified language would be beneficial to the world",
    "chosen": "When I was learning English - I was thinking the same. English is so simple - who not use it everywhere, right? What stopped me then, after my English became more decent, is the finding that language has a huge influence on how people perceive the world. And when I thought about it, not much of the great minds in history had English as their native language, despite the wide-spread of it. This to me suggest a possibility that other languages, more complex languages, like Chinese or Russian or even German, have other qualities, which might be more important than simplicity.\n\nThen the other answer to this possible problem would be - OK. Everyone, let's adopt (i.e.) Russian. This has problems again, because you have to somehow measure how suitable the language is. And what's more we would probably be loosing on some other aspects of some different languages. I don't think it's possible to somehow construct an optimal language or even find out what aspects of the language makes it optimal.\n\nAnd even if we say that it's indeed possible to derive an \"optimal\" language in both simplicity and richness of expression - we would still have a problem of variation. I don't think it would be good for a whole population to be located on some global maximum, no matter what that maximum is. Variation is crucial to survival. So (i.e.) if we wanted peace in the world - we might decide to erase all the anger from humans. We might try to do this via some hormonal therapies (I don't really know here). So our goal - everyone is peaceful, no hostility, etc. However these same angry people might be crucially important for us when the conditions change (when someone tries to invade our country for example, or in the case of humanity - planet). Similar thing might be going on with languages. We don't need to make everyone \"optimal\" we need to have a better chance of survival. And variation helps with that.\n\n(This is of course based on the idea that language has an influence on psyche. And there indeed are papers that suggest it to be true)",
    "rejected": "So you seem to have attempted to address the most obvious rejection to making a single language (cultural importance) in #3, but I don't really see how we are going to create a large language that somehow encompasses all cultures. You can't have your cake and eat it too; you're going to have to destroy a lot of culture if you force a universal language. If you wanted to create a language that accounted for all the different cultures in the world, that would just be like taking all languages, putting them into one, and calling it a \"single language.\" That wouldn't really be much different from how it is now.\n\nEvery language has their own expressions and sayings that sometimes don't even exist in another language. English has the most words than any other language, but there are tons of words and sayings in other languages that have no good equivalent in English. In fact, some of those sayings just make no sense in the context in other languages. In other cases, there are tons of ways to express one sentiment.\n\nLet's take a common English idiom: \"Well, that was a piece of cake.\" This pretty much makes no sense when you think about it literally in most situations (unless you're actually pointing out a piece of cake), and there are tons of other ways you could express that feeling without that idiom in English. But because it's a very common idiom, most people probably wouldn't want it abolished (nor can you really \"force\" an expression to die). But on the other side of the globe, why the hell would someone want to learn the idiom when they can just say \"that was easy\" in their own language? It has no cultural significance to them. Now, obviously, if it was just this one idiom, it wouldn't matter, but once you try to consider all the idioms out there in the world, I'm sure you can see how this can be a problem. The issue isn't just isolated to idioms, either; there are other more subtle ways the culture/structure problem manifests. With language comes different perspectives, ways of thinking, history, etc. It would be quite a loss to get rid of it all.\n\nSo why can't we just create a language that has all these different words, but people can use the same phrases? Why can't people literally just say \"that was a piece of cake,\" in, say, Mandarin, if Mandarin becomes the universal language? Idioms don't really work that way --they develop partly because in that particular language, there are certain phrases that roll better off the tongue (which in itself also brings up another point: the different kinds of pronunciation in languages are fascinating, but that goes hand in hand with the culture argument). The equivalent to \"piece of cake\" in Chinese is a phrase that translates literally do \"small dish.\" But it would feel pretty silly to start shouting \"small dish!\" in English, for both those who speak Mandarin and English. \n\nNot to mention the fact at this point in the world, we're frankly still not \"globalized\" enough in various ways (not just culture, but economy, necessities, environment) to have a single language. And I'm not necessarily talking about logistics; certain languages are developed to fit into certain cultures, and languages will deviate within themselves when there are different groups of people. Check out China: the country is so vast that the same language ended up segmenting into different versions. These versions developed into almost-different languages, even when the base alphabet is the same. Languages adapt around regions and cultures.\n\nMost languages have been developing for a very long time; they naturally evolve. We can actually see cross-cultural developments in language, too. English uses the Japanese word \"karaoke.\" Korean uses various English words like \"bus\" or \"chocolate.\" Instead of forcing a single unified language, we can let language take its course."

    "chosen": "I really don't think it's possible to \"change your view\" on this, because \"creeping\" is such an ambiguous word.\n\nThere is definitely a colloquial use of \"creeping\" that doesn't imply anything negative. Also, it's frequently thrown around in a sarcastic manner, or simply as a joke. \n\nThis really has to be broken down into a case-by-case basis, and even then, you might just be misunderstanding somebody.\n\nI will say that I think \"creeping\" is thrown around more casually these days in that specific context because of the ubiquity of social networks. *Everybody* has a Facebook page, and most people have so many Facebook friends that 80% of the content their friends post never even makes it to their timeline.\n\nSo with that in mind, depending on what specifically you mention as having seen on somebody's Facebook, that almost automatically implies that you put in an effort above and beyond simply becoming Facebook friends and passively monitoring your own personal timeline. It may be a trivial amount of effort, but if somebody becomes aware of the fact that you actively searched through their profile in particular, it is unsettling to some degree... again, this is highly contextual. Nobody wants to suddenly realize that the person they just became Facebook friends with yesterday poured through 5 years of their history and actually paid enough attention to bring up something that happened years ago. The actual act of quickly scanning a new friend's profile isn't really weird, but you have to admit, in a real life social situation, it's a bit awkward to bring something up from it that you weren't personally involved in that happened a long time ago. It just makes you seem like you're coming on really strong.\n\nAlso, I think in most people's minds, there is still a disconnect between social networks and reality. Sometimes it's just a bit unsettling to realize that everything you put on social media reaches a MUCH larger audience than you might have *really* intended for it to, harmless or not.\n\nSo there are a number of reasons for some people reacting negatively to bringing up something from a social network. I'm not sure that really changes your view at all, but it's an interesting discussion.",
    "rejected": "One problem is that neither Facebook nor humans have ultra fine ways of filtering their content. You might have a couple groups that you limit access to, but even that's quite a bit of effort and not very effective. \n\nSay you just become friends with someone. You likely weren't part of their lives in any meaningful way five years ago. You don't know that much about their personal history. They aren't the same person they were then either - they look different, hold different opinions and have a different assortment of friends. \n\nThere's nothing at all strange or off putting for my old friends from elementary school to visit my mom and look through her old photo albums. If someone I recently met did that, that would be incredibly disturbing. What are they really trying to get at? Do they think that this old content is going to give them insight into me and my life, and if so, that's a pretty high level of effort and personal engagement. \n\nFacebook has also changed *a lot*. These days it's very much about transient social interactions. Personal information is off the main page and pictures usually just get thrown up rather than put in organized folders. I'd argue that interactions, images and often even personal information on Facebook aren't nearly as good of a way to get a sense of someone as they once were. \n\nWhen you comment on an old item, you are usually doing it out of context.  Commenting publicly is also a performative public act, not a personal communication. \n\nStill, this also doesn't mean that there aren't people that need to chill. Some people literally consider it to be 'creeping' if you mention the things they've posted publicly to them in person. It's almost like they're so detached from their social media life that they don't fully identify with the person that generated and shared that content. That's stupid. \n\nSome people call any interaction with their public content by someone they don't like 'creeping'. No, you should unfriend or restrict them if you don't want them seeing your content or ask them to stop if you don't like their comments.\n\nBut the above arguments don't address those cases - they look at the cases where digging up old content be a real signal that someone's both extremely, perhaps worrisomely enthralled with your life and feels the need to respond to it performatively. Remember, it's not just looking when you Comment or Like - it's a public performance. "

    "prompt": "If the middle eastern conflict is really as simple as Israel wanting peace, yet Palestine wanting only to destroy Israel, why is there so much global support for Palestine?",
    "chosen": "The Palestinians made themselves become the ultimate victim. And considering their status they truly are.  \nThe problem is that their status is mostly caused by lots of different causes most of which aren't talked about on the world news because it's easier to see good guys and bad guys even if the situation is much more complex.  \nI'll give you a couple of reasons the Palestinians have it this bad that are much worse (in my opinion) than the Israeli government.\n  \n1) Hamas - Hamas is a terrorist organisation known by most of the western world as such.  \nIt holds full control of the Gaza strip and it got it's power by force (when Israel left the Gaza strip and surrounding areas a political party called the Fatah was democratically chosen to be in charge. they were driven out by force, having most of it's high ranking members killed and their bodies dragged through the streets.)\nThe Hamas organization only wants the complete destruction of the state of Israel to establish an Islamic State just like the one currently forming in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), this organization doesn't care about the Palestinian people, and it actually uses them as human shield and as propaganda machine (there are accounts of Hamas invading a civilian house for launching rockets from it, killing the resident family in the process and then blaming the IDF for doing it.)  \nThe point you have to realize is that Hamas is at war with Israel, and the Palestinians are kept hostages in the middle of it all.\n\n2) Other mid-east countries and the U.N - after Israel's independents war, there were a lot of Palestinian refugees fleeing to countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt (thinking the small newborn state o Israel has no chance to survive this war raged against 3 enemy states. and believing that soon they will return to their abandoned homes.)\nthese refugees are in that status for well over 60 years and no-one is trying to change that. they have their own special status in the U.N. unlike any refugee in any other part in the world, controlled by the corrupt UNRWA controlled by the states they are currently in.\nThey have practically no rights for labor, travel and free speech.\nThey are trapped in the status of refugee and can't change it, furthermore, them and all descendants of them are defined as refugees as well.  \nThis is also, to make them seem like the victims (which they are) and then blame it on Israel, otherwise how could they paint it as an evil state that must be eliminated?\n\n3) Corrupt leaders - Even though the state of things in the west bank is far better than whats happening in Gaza, things could be much better.  \nThe west bank gets millions of dollars in donations and foreign aid to help their institutions and education, these funds never reach their destination and remains in the hands of bureaucrats and politicians. When children have an almost wrecked school, The principle of said school lives in a palace of a house, with money received in education aid.  \n\nCurrently the situation for the Palestinians is awful and there are a lot of different reasons for it. but the main reason is because for a lot of powerful people usually in the arab world, there are agendas to be obtained and for that to happen the Palestinians need to look like victims. So they'll stay in the victim status, no matter what Israel does to try and change it.",
    "rejected": "The video is so biased it's almost funny. \n\n**1:20:** Here he talks about the war in 1948. As he said, this was when Israel was first formed. Before the, England was in control of the land (they had won it from the Ottoman Empire in WW1) and the Palestinians and Jewish settlers had already had a lot of violence between them. At this point Arabs greatly outnumbered Jews in the region, and the biggest goal of Zionists was to have as many Jews immigrate there as possible, so they could control the state easier. The Arabs in the area were poorly organized, and their allies had differing goals, which is part of the reason Israel won the war.\n\nWith that in mind, it's a lot easier to sympathize with the Arab states' decision to go to war. Israel was a country in which the Jewish minority ruled the Arab majority, an Arab majority that had lived there for thousands of years. It's actually quite similar to Native Americans fighting against Europeans.\n\n**1:30** This is where he talks about the 1967 war. If you listen to discussions about this today, you'll hear about the 1967 borders, referring to the borders that existed before this war. He actually described it accurately, but in a tone so you somehow sympathize with Israel. Israel launched a preemptive attack on the Arab states. As in the Israelis attacked first. And then they took land from the Palestinians, Egyptians, and Syrians. And we're supposed to be on Israel's side in this?\n\n**2:30** They gave some of the land they took back to Egypt? How generous.\n\n**2:50** The idea that all the Palestinians have to do is recognize Israel and agree to peace is simply a lie, there's no other way to put it. If you don't believe me, look up the \"scandal\" from a couple months ago where Chris Christi called the occupied territories the \"occupied territories\". If all Israel wanted was recognition and peace, giving those territories back to the Palestinians shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIn fact, the current Israeli government has done great harm to the peace process and seems to be unwilling to accept anything short of complete surrender from the Palestinians.\n\n**3:05** Again, even he admits that he just lied a couple seconds ago. Last time I checked 95% didn't equal 100%. Israel wants to trade land they took from the Palestinians for peace, but not all of it. Wouldn't you be insulted if you were Palestinian?\n\n**4:55** This is a popular line among Zionists. \"Oh, there was never an Arab state there.\" It's technically true, but the Arabs had still been living there. They just hadn't been organized into a country. Did they ever have the opportunity to become a country? Nope, because, as he himself said, the British gave the land to the Jewish minority before the Arabs could even do anything.\n\nToday Jews are the majority in Israel. You know why? Because many Arabs fled the country to escape the war of 1948, and when the war ended, Israel refused to let them return to their homes. This is still an issue today, and Israel still refuses to allow them to return. It's called \"the right of return\", and is the second biggest issue preventing peace behind land. I'll give you three guesses to which side is causing this barrier to peace.\n\nNow, the Paestinians and Arabs aren't completely innocent either. But we could have peace between Israel and the Arab states tomorrow if Israel agreed to the 1967 borders, allowed the right of return, and allowed Palestine to become a country (ironic, considering how he ended the video). This is a little oversimplified, but any independent person who has studied the issue has come to the same conclusion.\n\nIsrael complains that this would involve them giving in on everything. But they were the ones who fucked everything up. They took land from their neighbors. They refuse the right of return. And they refuse to allow Palestine to become a country (mainly through their influence on the US). \n\nIn fact, you'll see that a lot of Presidents try to avoid this issue. On the one hand, they know what the right answer is, and we could easily get it if we wanted. On the other hand, the Zionist lobby in the US is extremely powerful, and the President doesn't want to get them angry at him. "

How we treat each others is a secondary concern/consequence - how we treat ourselves is primary - it has existential primacy, which means it is more fundamental. (This primacy of how we treat ourselves is implied by the gold and silver rules, but not the platinum). \n\nThe core of morality is that the individual has the capacity to choose, and all choices have different consequences that one choice is better and of greater value than another. To deliberately choose a greater value over the lesser is the core of morality, and to choose the bad over the good is the core of immorality.\n\nThe Gold and Silver rules are only as good as this more fundamental aspect of morality, how you treat yourself. Even Robinson Crusoe, alone on an island, has choices to make that make him either a virtuous man who works hard and struggles to do the right things to survive, or an immoral man who ignores his circumstances and chooses to laze on the beach wishing vainly for the coconuts to fall.\n\nThere are thousands of virtues (and vices) that have nothing to do with others, but that require a sustained effort of moral/righteous choices to attain *such as*: self-honesty, integrity, clarity of mind, industry, productiveness, rationality, creativity, focus/concentration, imagination, pride, courage, determination, knowing when to reward/punish yourself, knowing when to push on or rest etc etc!\n\nThe Golden and Silver rules are only as useful to society as the virtues you have yourself!

If you really wanna get into it movies, television, literature, music and art really don't have any external benefits to society. I know lots of people (and I bet you do to) who look down on others because of their choices in entertainment. Unlike football, some of those have actually been used to opress people in the past (propaganda, book burnings, religious texts etc) Should we move away from those too?\n\n&gt; The 100 hour war, between Honduras and El Salvador, was triggered by a football game. Granted, the game itself was a small block removed from an already very unstable Jenga tower, but it seems to me that all football does it bring out the tribalistic, irrational animal in people that allows the 100 hour war and the Hillsborough disaster to happen. \n\nAnd during WW2 soldiers stopped fighting to [play a match of football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce), stories like that aren't enough crucify the sport. Hillsborough was mainly blamed on the police letting too many people into the stadium. An avoidable tragedy yes, but not entirely blamed on football.\n\n&gt; I can't see it as a tool for peace or friendship or discourse or understanding; all I see is anger, rivalry, shouting. It reinforces the same sort of in-group-out-group \"You belong to a different tribe therefore you are bad\" mentality that leads to xenophobia, and from there, racism and overzealous nationalism (read: UKIP.) This sort of mentality is something we need to keep a lid on, I believe, if we want to have a more peaceful society. \n\nSo does religion, politics and science. You can find hostile divisions anywhere people are forced to take sides on something. I am not from the UK, but I read up briefly on UKIP and I didn't see any mention of them being Chelsea fans so I don't see how that is relevant. Osama Bin Laden was an Arsenal fan though, you maybe you can use that when making irrelevant connections. \n\nI think you are putting way too much on football.

But I don't think that applies to all \"classics.\"    \n    \nBut try looking at the issue in reverse.  There are some modern games which are well received despite the fact that they don't really push the envolope in terms of modern technology.  Or they have some nice graphics, but they aren't games where graphics are critical, and the rest of the game could have been made years ago.    \n    \nI mean like at Starcraft II.  It was very popular, despite the fact that it's not really modern.  Even at release, it was basically a ten year old game with a bit more polish and some graphics boost.  Or league of legends, one of the most popular games in the world.  I'm not a computer expert, but I'm guessing it's not exactly pushing the envelope of modern technology.  The graphics aren't groundbreaking to begin with, and the game would be almost the exact same experience with older graphics. And the rest of it doesn't seem advanced at all.    \n     \nI mean I havn't played the newer smash bros very much, but other than looking better, are the significantly technologically improved from smash bros 64?    \n    \n______     \n    \nThat being said, if your point is just \"people only think some older classics are good because of nostalgia goggles,\" well that view can't really be changed because it borders on fact rather than opinion.    \n     \nAlthough you do seem to be implying a game has to hold up to modern standards to be a classic, which I strongly disagree with.  Yeah, Goldeneye sucks by modern standards, but it's still a classic for how good it was at the time.   I mean I'm no car expert, but aren't many \"classic\" antique cars objectively worse than similar quality modern cars?"

Saying that subtle irony exists does not explain why her examples must be, or are more likely subtly ironic than just not ironic at all.\n\nRebuttal to rebuttal #3: You're attempting to take clear evidence that you are wrong and find some reason to discount it.

While sexist comments undoubtedly crept into the criticisms, I think it's unfair to say that they drove the comments rather than turned them ugly.  It more likely just people loving to hate on something popular like they do with Justin Beiber now.\n",

    "chosen": "[Here](http://www.princeton.edu/~pager/pager_ajs.pdf) (pdf warning) is a paper titled \"The effect of a criminal record\" published in the American journal of Sociology.  It seems pretty damning for your view.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is comparing the effect of having a prior conviction for a drug related offense on someone's record when applying for a job and to determine whether or not the effect is similar across races.  The findings are neatly outlined in the section titled \"The effects of race\" it is towards the end.  Here is a key point:\n\n&gt;Figure 6 presents the percentage of callbacks received for both cate-\ngories of black testers relative to those for whites. The effect of race in\nthese findings is strikingly large. Among blacks without criminal records,\nonly 14% received callbacks, relative to 34% of white noncriminals  \n\nThe researcher found that callbacks to white interviewers without a criminal record happened 34% of the time.  For black applicants without a record, callbacks were only 14% of the time.  This, in itself, is signifigant evidence of racial prejudice.\n\nWhites with criminal records were called back 17% of the time.  In other words, for a white guy, having a criminal record halves your chances at getting a job.  You'll notice a white convict is still likelier to get a job than a black person with no criminal history.  Even worse, for black convicts the call back rate is 5%.  Your odds have diminished to 35% of where they were originally if you are a black convict.\n\nSo, to sum up, in America black men are less likely to get a job (when controlling for education and experience as outlined in the linked paper).  On top of this, black criminals are punished more severely in their job hunts than are white criminals.  Each of these facts suggests a racial bias against blacks.",
    "rejected": "I've posted this before on CMV, but it seems applicable.\n\nPrinceton professor Devah Pager put together a [study a few years ago](http://www.princeton.edu/~pager/race_at_work.pdf) wherein they assembled matched teams of young male applicants to apply for 1,470 real-world entry-level jobs in NYC. The testers were given fictional resumes (engineered so that they showed the applicants to have equivalent education, quality of high school, work experience and neighborhood of residence), then matched up according to physical attributes (similar height, physical attractiveness, verbal skill and interactional style) and coached so that they would interview in a uniform matter. While testing, all testers were clean-shaven and dressed in a similar manner (appropriate for the interviews). \n\nDr. Pager's team found that white applicants were about twice as likely to be called back for the position, despite everything else about the applicants being normalized. They were able to get the results to equal out by varying the applicant's background; white applicants whose records showed that they had been convicted of a felony were about as likely to get a positive response as were black or hispanic applicants whose record showed that they had never been convicted of a crime.\n\nFurther, white applicants were more likely to be \"channeled up\", offered a better position than they'd been applying for. Black applicants were never channeled upwards, but were channeled downwards (offered a worse position than they'd applied for). White applicants were channeled down less often, and then only when they had a criminal background.\n\nAll of that said, everywhere is different and each individual is going to face a completely different set of circumstances.

    "chosen": "Let's go by your points one by one:\n\n1. It's easy to say this so casually when your entire way of life and your actual life itself is not what's at risk. A war with North Korea could trigger some very hard times for both North and South. Any economic benefits to be reaped would likely be in the long term. It's easy to call for sacrifice when you are not the one sacrificing. Who is to say unification will save lives? Violent, forced unification might cause extreme civil unrest, decades of terrorism, and continued or even accelerated loss of life on both sides. Unifying through full on war and unifying post-North Korean collapse are very different prospects that entail different likelihoods of success.\n\n2. That is true. Many experts predict that unification could be an economic boon. The same Goldman Sachs report that you are unknowingly referencing also states that this is under the assumption of most optimal circumstances (i.e. gradual and peaceful reunification). That circumstance is only most likely post natural internal North Korean collapse and not through violent takeover. North Korea is not ready to be a stable state if taken over.\n\n3. 60 years of consisted foreign policy doesn't change overnight. Their greatest concerns aren't cultural ones and more military. China, despite being a large coastal country, is landlocked militarily speaking by two great island chains - both of which are, in one way or another, under US control. The Korean peninsula is part of these chains (they form the mainland connection to the islands). North Korea falling further exacerbates America's cornering of China. It's a militarily strategic concern more than anything.\n\nAgain, I think it's important to emphasize this. It's easy to be hawkish when it's not your life that's being thrown away. Some things to keep in mind.",
    "rejected": "The government of South Korea represents the people of South Korea, not the entire Korean peninsula.  War and re-unification would be terrible for South Koreans, even if it would probably help North Koreans in the long run.\n\nSouth Korea is already an economic powerhouse, they don't need the north for that. Taking on the cost of modernizing North Korea would put an incredible strain on the government and the nation as a whole.  It would hurt their economy for decades, not help it.\n\nSo war would cost many South Korean lives and significant destruction in South Korea, and it wouldn't gain them anything other than tremendous debt."

    "chosen": "This is a very broad topic, but there is one point you are greatly over-simplifying: \"...any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school.\" \n\nThat sounds great in principle, but how do you determine whether someone deserves government support? There are so many loop-holes that closing all of them is nearly impossible without imposing unreasonable regulations on what is an acceptable life-style. \n\nI could easily enroll in a low-tier community college, pick low-work major, sign up for the minimum hours to be a full-time student, and pass all my classes without attending them and with no more than an hour or two or work a week. I could probably do this for 8 years before I graduated. Meanwhile, I could sit and browse reddit all day. Should I be getting all your socialist benefits?\n\nAlternatively, suppose I want to go into some exotic profession like streaming video games. There are hundreds of people out there that end up making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by streaming because they have built up a viewer-base of tens of thousands of people. But to get that viewerbase, you need to constantly be producing content, and the process of acquiring viewers is very slow and it took ages for many of the popular streamers to get above a dozen people tuning in. How do you differentiate between someone who sits and plays video games all day verses the next pro-gamer that will entertain a hundred thousand viewers a day?\n\nWhat if I want to go out and make the new app that sells millions of copies? How long can I come out with unsuccessful flappy-birds until your system stops supporting me?\n\nAnd about that person seeking work... they have a nice resume, went and got themselves a good degree, have some experience, but no one is hiring them. Their personality is simply terrible and no one wants to work with them. Then what? \n\nI do not believe that socialism is fundamentally wrong, but you can't just provide everyone's basic needs if they are \"productive members of society\" without some serious problems arising. \n\nPeople are very much inherently lazy and many already do the minimum they need to not get fired. When you give them a socialist safety blanket, they will continue to do the minimum they need to keep it. If you want to advocate such an extreme form of socialism (what you suggested is much more extreme than what any socialist country right now has), your system is doomed to fail until you find some way of closing pretty much every loophole of how you trick the system.

The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot).\n\n\nWell that's not a fair argument since the Soivet Union, North Korea, and other Socialist countries back in the 70s and 80s were known to use the worste envirmental standards in the world.\n\nAlso the reason we need oil production still is the fact we need things, even solar power, hydro, wing, and electronic cars still use oil in the production of that item. \n\n\n\n&gt; Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.\n\nTo those people I say what job are they working? My degree is going to allow me to make a decent living, while a lot of people who have taken weak degree are falling behind, because they think, because they have a degree they should be paid a good salary."

    "chosen": "Im going to break down your points one by one.\n\n* Latency.\n\nThis is not a problem with touchscreens themselves, but rather an issue with the shitty touchscreens companies put in vending machines.  Good touchscreens have almost 0 latency (orders of nanoseconds).  Therefor this is not an argument against touchscreens, but rather against shitty design decisions.\n\n* Tactile feedback. \n\nWhile there isn't tactile feedback, there is VISUAL feedback, which is huge.  On a touchscreen you can instantly tell if the button press was registered, on a machine with no screen, this isn't possible.\n\nOn machines with screens and physical buttons there is another issue, mapping.  How do you know what button connects to what?  Touchscreens solve this issue very well.\n\n* Power requirement. Judging by my smartphone, touch screens require a hefty amount of power to keep them operating. Even if I'm exaggerating, a physical button interface requires 0 power.\n\nThe power requirement of a well designed touch screen is negligible.  Typically in the region of half a watt.  When your vending machine is drawing 800 watts to keep itself refrigerated, this is completely negligible and makes essentially 0 difference to the company.\n\nAnd of course you are completely glossing over the biggest reason companies use touchscreens.  Advertising and promotions.  Vending machines are trying to sell a product, a nice big colourful touchscreen with moving images is much more eye catching than a bunch of buttons and helps a company achieve their overall goal of selling more product. ",
    "rejected": "Aside from power consumption, your cons (aka things that suck) are things that will improve with time and improved design. The first touch screen phones and tablets were market disasters and resulted in massive losses for the designers. But with customer feedback, advances in technology, and other innovations smart phones and tablets are common items many of us rely on every day.\n\nI embrace progress. Perhaps touchscreen vending machines are unnecessary today, but I still encourage anyone trying to improve a product or process!"

    "prompt": "variable tax is immoral, or at least bad.",
    "chosen": "&gt; inasmuch as how there is a justification for the government to take a larger percentage of your money because you earn more\n\nThis is a common misunderstanding of how marginal tax rates work.  If you make more money, the tax rate only changes on money made above the threshold.  This is an important distinction.\n\nFor example, in the US you pay 10% on earning up to $9,075.  Then you pay 15% tax on money made **between** $9,076 and $36,900.\n\nSo, someone who makes $10,000 doesn't pay a 15% tax rate.  There actual tax is \n\n* 10% on $9,075 = $907.50\n* 15% on $925 = $138.75\n\nFor a total tax burden of 1046.25 or an effective tax rate of 10.46%",
    "rejected": "As a place to begin, I want to make sure we're discussing the same system here.  A graduated (or progressive) tax system does **not** punish you for earning more.\n\nA simplistic variable system would look like -\n\n- For the first $0 - $9,999 of income - Tax Rate = 0%\n- For the income between $10,000 - $29,999 - Tax Rate = 10%\n- For the income between $30,000 - $74,999 - Tax Rate = 20%\n- For the income greater than $75,000 - Tax Rate = 35%\n\nKeep in mind that if you make $15,000 in a year you aren't taxed 10% on the whole amount ($1,500) but rather 0% on the first $9,999 and then 10% on the remaining $5001 (for $500.10) so the resulting total tax paid in this example is $500.10\n\nAs you scale up the government does take more money... but your net income (after tax) *is also increasing*.  \n\nAs for why increased earners should pay more % tax - because they can actually sustain the loss.  All humans have the same basic requirements for life (ie Food, Clothing, Shelter) plus additional requirements (Transportation, Entertainment, Education etc.) that need to be met in some fashion.  While it is true that the rich tend to have larger expenses, a simple thought exercise leads to the conclusion that (unless your rich person is insanely overspending) as their income grows the total % of their income devoted to \"necessities\" as opposed to \"luxuries\" declines.  \n\nBy that logic, asking the higher income people to carry more of the burden makes sense - the people who are most able to sustain the loss are the ones taking the loss, while the people who are least able to sustain take the least loss."

People who lie or misdirect are exposed. A person who asks for help with a question, a pizza, or an engaging discussion are answered. Generally, content is separated into subreddits so that people can curate what they can and cannot see.\n\nThe end result is that reddit is a place where people can enjoy content that pushes the boundaries of what our culture finds acceptable without turning into a playground for sociopaths like 4chan. You can subscribe to /r/ImGoingToHellForThis and get a steady stream of not-quite-for-polite-company humor from strangers all over the internet because we have a system that works.

    "prompt": "Tourism is bad, and tourists are ignorant.",
    "chosen": "&gt;Tourism causes the inflation of a country to rise dramatically.\n\nYou cite no evidence for this. Furthermore later in your post you state that the vast majority of tourists only see the \"standard\" sites and amusements and do not expand their visit to more mundane areas.\n\nIf there are no tourists in the majority of the country (because they are clustered around the attractions) how are they contributing to inflation. I live in New York City, a slice of Pizza *is* more expensive in Times Square...however that has little to no bearing on the cost of Pizza in Brooklyn...or Kansas.\n\n&gt;Even in cities like Berlin[1] . We see rent hikes, and gentrification caused by tourism. \n\nThe article you cite does not indicate how prevalent these illegal hotels are. The illegal use of residential properties for commercial purposes is a problem and *does* lead to higher rents. But that is not an argument against tourism. That is an argument *for* enforcement of existing laws intended to protect the housing supply for locals. The *real* problem cited in your article is *not* the ignorant \"traditional\" tourists you are talking about. It's the foreigners who are trying to integrate into the community - on a temporary basis. A tourist spending a week in a hotel room has a lot less impact than a rich person buying an apartment which they occupy for 3 months out of the year. \n\nAlso, the article does not really get into the cause and effect of tourism and gentrification. As a New Yorker, I have seen Harlem become a destination for foreign tourists when previously it was not. To be very clear, the tourists did not gentrify Harlem. Instead the neighborhood was gentrified organically and the tourists began to go there when it was deemed \"safe\".\n\n&gt; Countries will try to put their best foot forward when it comes to tourists. You will not be able to get a good view of a country when you're only visiting amusement parks, beaches, and landmarks that only tourists go to see (I've lived in Auckland all my life and not once have I gone bungy-jumping off the sky tower or the harbour bridge)\n\nSome tourists occupy themselves with superficial activities. Some will try to see the museums, cultural landmarks, and local culture to properly understand and experience the place. If you want the rest of the world to have any understanding of your lifestyle, culture, principles etc you must have people experiencing the latter. And since you can't police people's activities that closely you pretty much have to tolerate the former.\n\n&gt;most tourists don't even speak the language of the country their visiting and have a tourist guide/translator.\n\nSo? Is the alternative that everyone just sequesters themselves off into little pockets of culturally similar people and never intermingles. People are often inspired to learn a language and *really* get to know a place after visiting it a couple times. Suggesting that visiting a place with a guide is somehow bad simply cuts down on intercultural dialogue. Honestly this sort of attitude leads to increased world conflict as people have a diminished empathy for people from other cultures (because there is so little first hand experience).\n\n&gt;The unfortnate result of this is a fake culture that is a caricature of the place that exists solely to rip tourists off (find me a New Yorker that actually calls NY “the big apple”).\n\nConflating some harmless sloganeering with \"fake culture\" is a little extreme. It's not like there are parts of NYC where people are walking around talking like the Sopranos just for the benefit of the tourists. \n\n&gt;I'll end this paragraph on a bitter note and invoke the W word: weeaboo.\n\nThis is probably your only good point in this CMV. When you take the impulses that inspire tourism to an extreme you end up with cultural fetishism as seen in the Weeaboo sub-culture. *That's* actually a problem because you are viewing the subject culture through a very narrow lens and no longer treating them as complete people. I do not think *most* tourists cross that line. The vast majority are there to see things they have not seen, eat things they have not eaten, experience things they have not experienced - they are not bringing with them a great deal of cultural baggage about how the place they are visiting \"should be\" or \"is\".\n\n&gt;They treat other countries like their playground, when in reality they're also communities with their own cultures and attitudes.\n\nThey are on vacation and are seeking entertainment. I do not see how this necessarily results in them devaluing the culture of the locals.\n\n&gt;We've all seen tourists standing in the middle of the side walk in a large group, taking pictures of the most mundane things; while the rest of us want to get to school/work. \n\nAnd sometimes while I go to school or work someone with a day off is out having fun. This does not bother me. I find it difficult to comprehend why you think people being on vacation while others work is so objectionable.\n\n&gt;Not everyone in Hawaii is always surfing, not everyone in the Netherlands is stoned all the time, not everyone in Berlin is always partying. \n\nYes, but when people want to have fun in Hawaii a great many of them surf. When people go out in Berlin a fair amount will go to one of the world class clubs. The Netherlands is a very special case because prohibition in other countries drives up the foreign consumption of drugs to levels not seen in the local population. This is not a problem with tourism but with poor drug policies.\n\n&gt;You can't say you've visited a country until you've lived and worked there for over a year.\n\nThis is just silly. ",

And, yes, packaged tours tend to  stay in big international hotels - you can't do a tour for 100 people and put them all up in B&amp;Bs or small, local inns.

For those who take the time to research, and shun packaged tours, you'll find a far higher percent staying local.\n\nFor your next point, yes, in most places you can only see the \"nice areas\", and get a slanted view of a place.

    "chosen": "The Clinton thing doesn't concern me.  Bill was President from 92 to 2000. Hillary's riding his coattails.  She fought tooth and nail during the 08 primary for the democratic nomination and lost fair and square to Obama.  She wants to throw her hat in the ring again, and that's her right.  Chelsea Clinton hasn't followed her parents into politics, aside from stumping for her mother, so it's unlikely there's a political dynasty in the making.\n\nThe Bush thing is more an anomally than a trend. George Sr. was a successful politician, was elected Vice President on the Reagan ticket from 80 to 88. (it's important to note that VP of the US has litte official power, just to cast the tie-breaking vote in the senate, and to replace the president if he dies), he was elected president from 88 to 92.  He had two kids that followed him in to politics.  I don't think there's much doubt that both benefited from their dad's name in early campaigns, but nepotism only goes so far.  His campaigns were orchestrated by political genius/satan incarnate Karl Rove, who knew exactly how to brand him, and ran effective smear campaigns in governor, primary and presidential races.  That is, his winning strategy was to make the opposing candidates look bad rather than bringing attention to his own.\n\nJeb on the other hand went the florida route.  He did his bachelor's in Latin American Studies and is fluent in Spanish.    he made a name for himself in florida politics and accomplished a lot, probably due to his own merits as much as the family name.  He's being tapped as a possible presiential candidate, not just because of his name, but because of his conservative voting record, he can appeal to traditional conservatives as well as (they hope) the Hispanic population, which is an increasingly important voting bloc, they are generally socially conservative but still vote more democratic.  However, unlike George W Bush, the family name and association with his brother may be more of an uphill battle in the presidential election. ",

Personally, I'm a republican so I hate Hillary, I should like bush, but I really don't want another bush in the White House, and as stupid as the republicans are I think they're smart enough to not try to put another bush in the White House.\n\nSecondly:  it's just our political system.  Forgetting names (because arguably we can take this to the \"first\" political dynasty in America with the Adams Family), how we elect a president is fair, and if the people vote for the dynasty, we will get a dynasty.  If the people vote for Marco Rubio, or Bernie Sanders, or Rand Paul, then the people will get one of them, we don't have to have a political dynasty.  Also, a little pointing out, the democrats are going to push Hillary, she's the strongest candidate they have, but there are too many people who don't like Hillary.  \n\nAnyways it's only a bad thing if the American people say it's a bad thing."

If these subs ban anyone who opposes their views, then that restricts the audience that can hear what they are saying. I'd imagine many of these subs are echo-chambers that reinforce whatever beliefs they hold. These subs are essentially then just online meeting places, where at one time a meeting might be in a house, now it's on Reddit.\n\nLastly, if a comment is made in another public subreddit (similar to the real-life protests you mentioned) the upvote and downvote arrows can be used a means of protesting if the comment does not contribute, and commenting on it with a contrary view can also be done.",

They can also ban people from their meetings who don't share their views or speak out against them.\n  \nSubreddits are like those meeting places.  Such hate groups on reddit you mentioned are free to discuss what they wish on their subs but as soon as their members bring their views outside their sub, they are open to criticism.  Similarly, like physical meeting places, people who disagree with their views can be banned from their subs.  \n  \nIf you want to make the point that the subs are public, well so are a lot of church services.

But all morality is a compromise. If I truly lived to my own moral standards, I would be giving far more to the needy, living more frugally, using my free time to be politically active in causes I believed in, etc etc. Instead I do what I can, and accept I am not perfect. Every little bit counts. This is not a reason to not try.\n\nThere is no moral difference between two worlds where in one, half the world was vegan, and the other, everyone just ate half as much meat and dairy.",
    "rejected": "First of all, it doesn't matter what you think someone's reason should be, people have different reasons. Neither being vegetarian nor being vegan makes any difference, so you can easily say that every vegetarian \"should\" be an activist and fight harder to make a change.\n\nI totally understand that some people simply don't want to part take in something they see as negative. I was always against bad treatment of animals but i wasn't vegetarian because it wouldn't make a difference. Because of my dog, one day it got harder to have the distance between meat and animal I felt before and meat got less appealing to me. I don't think by not eating it I am making a change, but I feel cleaner personally. And I will still occasionally eat it if I feel like it or it is simpler than a veggie option. \n\nPeople can choose to which extent they want to get into something. I would never give up dairy because I love it and benefit to the world is non existent. But I assume many vegetarians can get their dairy and eggs from better sources, local farms etc where animals aren't treated badly. For some it is a purely health concern, so all together, there is an incentive to treat animals better for these purposes. Since it is totally possible to eat eggs from chickens who live decent lives, no one needs to be vegan,\n\n\nHaving said all that, things still add up. so between people concerned about their own health, moral vegetarians, total vegans, occasional vegetarians, people who simply care about their sources of food etc, a trend is being created that might lead to more humane methods of treating animals. So it's pointless to say what someone should do if they care, and let people choose in which way they want to participate and what is good and healthy for them."

Pirating it on another platform to bypass that restriction goes against their wishes and is wrong.\n\nFor example, if my business sells sandwiches, and a particular customer requests that a sandwich be made without lettuce, I should have the right to refuse to do so.

We'd have to accept that in your premise that it is okay to pirate because:\n\nEven though you may willfully believe that you are compensating the developers purely for a vaguely similar value of the product; that is not what is happening in reality.

If I understand you correctly, you're claiming that the question is some variation of: \"Is science hindered by creationism?\" That was not the premise. The question is rather simply: \"Is it a viable option?\" Ham might have indeed decided to interpret the topic the way you understand it, but the language is clear to me. No where in the topic does it mention anything about technology or scientific progress, or generally anything at all related to your belief here.\n\nHam unabashedly used many logical fallacies and barely touched on the topic.\n\"Viable model of origins\" He claims that because some scientists are biblical creationists, it must be a viable model. Testimony merely shows that scientists can be creationists as well. That's all well and good but how does that show any evidence to support it as a viable option?\n\nOn the other side, Nye gave a clear and concise presentation of evidence concerning evolution. He further pointed out that there was no evidence supporting creationism. This addressed the topic well. When asked \"Is this a viable model of origin?\" Nye definitely gives a resounding \"No.\"\n\n",
    "rejected": "My impression was that Bill Nye wiped the floor with Ham.\n\nI think Ham would've actually had to prove a great deal beyond the possibility of scientific progress to prove that his model is viable. By the standard you seem to set, any model that didn't deny present natural laws and the scientific method would've been viable.\n\nWhat I believe he would have had to do (and what Nye showed that he couldn't do) was provide a shred of positive evidence that would suggest his model was true.  All Ham had were minor inconsistencies or blind spots in science that would, if exploited enough, allow the theoretical possibility of his model.  But he was making positive claims that were unfalsifiable based on that theoretical possibility.  Science rests upon the testing of falsifiable claims, so what he was doing was not science; it was rationalization.  He wasn't providing evidence for his positive claim, he was trying to discredit evidence that disproved his claim and subsequently claim that his model had parity with one that had accepted the evidence he didn't consider credible.\n\nNye called him out on that several times.  He demanded explanations for the existence of organisms that are older than his model would allow; Ham said the dating methods were dumb.    Nye asked how so many layers of snow could've fallen in so short a time; Ham said the dating methods were dumb.  Nye asked how so many species could've evolved in such a short span of time; I don't recall Ham even touching that one.  Nye asked how a ship that we probably couldn't build today was built by 8 people who weren't shipwrights by trade; Ham said they could have been awesome shipwrights and that the 1% of the Ark he'd built looked pretty sturdy.\n\nNone of those responses are evidence to support a positive claim.  To show his model was viable, Ham had to prove that it was at least as possible as the mainstream model.  He failed to do so and Nye highlighted that aspect quite well.\n\nTL;DR - To prove his model was viable, Ham needed to prove probability, not possibility.  He needed to provide evidence, not just question the evidence of the opposition.  Nye pointed out that he needed this evidence, asked for it...and Ham rolled snake eyes."

He actually lost his medical license over it. \n\nThompson's findings only showed an increased risk after multiple subset limitations. This makes the conclusion highly unreliable (the raw data did *not* support a link between Vaccines and Autism).\n\nThere is a vast medical consensus that vaccines are safe and effective. The fact is, there really isn't a controversy in medically knowledgable spheres. It's only the uneducated, following charlatans that has created an *illusion* of controversy (in a very similar manner to climate change deniers). Always look at *where* the controversy is coming from.  \n\n&gt;There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.\n\nResearch some of the diseases these vaccines cured and then talk about \"horror stories\". The rare harm that vaccines cause is far outweighed by the elimination of the diseases.\n\nThat's not to say that the vaccine (and larger medical) industry is entirely without issue, but there is no reputable organization that doubts a) the effectiveness of vaccines or b) the general (not perfect) safety.\n\nIt may be helpful to know what exactly you think is wrong with vaccines, so we can narrow the articles we show you.",
    "rejected": "&gt;  Between whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.\n\n\nThe problem with this argument is that it is open ended and not grounded in a fact or idea.  It is as hard to dispute it as it is to dispute the comment *\"I am scared\"*.  \n\nWhistle-blowers are essential to keep groups honest.  It doesn't mean that the whole system is better off gone.  It only means that there are more flaws than an entity would otherwise acknowledge.  I'm not familiar with everyone on the list, but considering that Obama immediately granted William Thompson immunity from any crimes for testifying clearly indicates that we're not looking at a conspiracy. He spoke out and he was encouraged to do so.\n\n&gt;  Now I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.\n\n\nAs /u/amazingmrbrock pointed out in what might be deemed *the laziest CMV comment in history* there's more at stake than what you can plainly see.  Specifically Herd Immunity.  That means that we are communally protected from diseases because they are less prevalent.  So for instance, babies younger than 1 year old or the elderly with weakened immune systems may not be able to be vaccinated.  However the lack of prevalence of the disease in society makes it that they are still safe.  So being vaccinated is not just about saving your life but it is about saving the lives of others around you.\n\n\nSeparately, it is important not to look at public policy from an empirical perspective.  Everyone will always know of a story about someone who suffered in some way.  This only points out that a system is not perfect, which was never really in contention. The only question is if the system is better than the lack of a system.  Which *statistics* do a much better job at proving.  Looking at the [Anti-vaccine Body count](http://www.antivaccinebodycount.com/Anti-Vaccine_Body_Count/Home.html) we can see staggering numbers in preventable diseases and deaths.  \n\nIf vaccines caused autism or had similar effects, then surely it would be measurable in a similar way.  We could reconcile that data against each other.  But in the absence of facts, horror stories take it's place.  I can see how gory details are more moving than a chart, but it doesn't make them more accurate."

Carter's 1980 SOTU was about access to oil as a vital interest of the US.

Maybe not.  There's certainly a degree of altruism in ensuring that ambulances still have gas in the tank or that Europe doesn't go to war with itself over resources again.

I would personally agree with you that wars were not really about oil or natural resources, but even if there you were to argue that there were gains made there, the main monetary gain from the US were the government contractors.  Its the companies that had contracts to produces military goods and who had other government contracts to supply the military or build projects in these countries that really made out.  The US decided to fight a war that it largely didn't actually have a way to pay for, and a lot of the money went to a lot of these huge government and military contractors to back the war efforts.  The executives and the investors in these companies made out like bandits all funded by the American tax payer.\n\nAs far as our intentions in the middle east, the US may have had the intention of fighting terrorism and continuing our role as the worlds police force, but after you get past those intentions you get a complete lack of understanding of the region and a strategy on how to accomplish the goals of the mission (of which there wasn't a clearly defined one).  As a whole, the US doesn't understand the roots of the conflict in the middle east all that well, and we assume that its a typical good guy/bad guy situation.  We just swoop in, take out the bad guy, and the good guys will cheer us on, we'll let the good guys take control, and come back in time for dinner.  Its not that clear in the middle east, and the US did little to understand how power voids would be filled when the US came in and took out whoever was in power.  We also assumed that the people wanted American style democracy rather than whatever systems of social order were in place, and frankly the people in those countries haven't embraced the democratic systems of government we've imposed on them.  I think most Americans believe in the concept of self determination, and frankly the US has basically gone in uprooted these countries because we felt they needed it, then told their people what they should be doing.  That's certainly suspect in my book.\n\nIn the end this part of the world is debatably no better now that it was before our involvement, and all we've done is spent a decade and a half fighting in wars that makes the region hate us.  You could also argue whether the US as a nation is any safer from terrorists due to our involvement in the region, and if we had the intent of fighting terrorism, yet we're not any safer, then what was the point.  This isn't at all taking into account the monetary costs of the war, and more significantly the costs our armed forces have paid with their health, sacrifices, and for some, their lives."

However, simply saying that doesn't warrant much of an argument, does it? \n\nThen again, *your* conviction is based on exactly that same thing. Quite simply, you're taking your own limited, personal experience and using it to reach a conclusion about the rest of the world. Anecdote  shouldn't be much basis for such sweeping conclusions, but unfortunately, that's how most people tend to think.\n\nSo, if your conviction on this subject comes from the experience of one person, does my own experience, as one person, negate that? If we're being logical, it should. I suppose you could say that I am lying, or that I'm simply too naive to see that my relationships truly *do* fit into your characterization. However, those issues of veracity are frankly the only things that could logically diminish my account in the overall formulation of your conclusions here.\n\nFurthermore, you've already admitted to having had a purely platonic male friend in the past. So, you know it is a possibility. However, you dismiss this as being an anomaly. Actually, after telling a story in which you confirm that these relationships *are* possible, you then immediately start to deny its  significance by saying, \"I think it MAY be possible\". Why, after you've already shown with an example that it in fact *is* possible, do you immediately introduce doubt by saying that it \"may\" be possible? Surely, you've already confirmed that it *is* possible. \n\nSo, now your only remaining issue is one of frequency. From your own experience, the vast majority of these relationships don't work. In this thread, you have many people telling you from *their* own experience that many actually do. So, perhaps your issues of frequency are more unique to you than you think. \n\nLet's look at your anomaly: You wrote, \" I always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even...\"\n \nAbout the possibility of hooking up you wrote, \"but I would respect my relationship enough that I'm not really interested in doing that anyway\".\n\nSo, if we demonstrate mutual trust by introducing our significant others to our different-gendered friends, and we respect our significant others enough to ensure we would never do something to  hurt them, it seems to help. It's at least a very good start, right?\n\nYou also wrote, \"I also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me.\n\nI'd say that certainly helps as well! I'm assuming there are plenty of  men in the world that you do not find sexually attractive, but also like their personalities. I'm also assuming that there are plenty of men out there who would feel the same about you. And, contrary to popular belief, even if you are a very attractive woman, not every man on earth is going to want to sleep with you. That being said, while a lack of sexual attraction helps, I don't think it's necessary at all. I think what is most necessary is trust and respect. \n\nThe bottom line is, you know it can work. You can even point to specific things that seem to make it work. Those specific things you pointed to really aren't anomalous! It sounds like your experience has been limited and you are not forming the right kinds of male-female relationships. \n\nI'd like to add this as a more in-depth counter-anecdote: \n\nI have a few attractive female friends that are not my wife. They are intelligent, kind, interesting, and fun people who *happen* to be good-looking women. They are simply people who I enjoy spending time with. In a couple of instances, they are people that my wife has introduced me to. Friends of her own, who I've grown close to. My wife works crazy hours, and I've gone out with them alone for meals, movies, concerts, etc. I have felt none of these characteristics you are talking about. It's not an ego boost, and I have no \"just in case\" thinking. That last part was the most bizarre to me. The idea of losing my wife is far too devastating to start considering \"backup plans\". In terms of the ego boost, I'm not sure what you mean exactly. I mean, I'm certain that my female friends aren't hanging out with me because I look like Brad Pritt...primarily because I don't. And I'm not walking around with my chest puffed because of the \"hot chick\" that's by my side. We are hanging out because we think one another's an interesting, fun enough person to hang out with. That may give an ego boost, but just as much as a same-gendered friend would. We're being validated as people. Another human enjoys our company. Of course it feels nice. It needn't be about sex!\n\nAnyways, I hope that with all the responses in this thread, at least someone will change your mind. Because, if not, you'll be losing nearly 50% of the population from your pool of potential friends! Friends are wonderful things, and they're not terribly easy to make and keep. Don't limit the possibilities.",

The issue I have with this case is that, after having read responses to your view, and your responses to them, you don't seem willing to accept that anyone else's reasoning is as sound as your past experiences. Whenever someone makes an argument that your view is flawed, you respond with an exception, the issue is always that they have misunderstood you, not that you don't agree with their logic.\n\nI have two points to make about this, the first is that it doesn't appear, to me, that you are willing to have your view changed. I think that you are certain that your experiences are characteristic of any interaction between any man and any woman. Which leads me to my second point, perhaps the relationships you base your view upon are flawed. If all of your male friends only want to sleep with you and have no other motives for being your friend then that  specific relationship is what is wrong, not every relationship between two platonic friends.\n\nI'd like to add that I haven't meant any of this to be condescending to you, but in my experience, addressing the reason that I don't think opposing views are able to penetrate someone's beliefs is an effective way of moving a discussion forward in a meaningful manner."

Again, this is because my hormonal sex is very important to my physiology.  \n\nLastly, I'll give you a social argument.  Most people see me as female and treat me as such, but if they somehow know that my birth sex is male that goes out the window.  They are likely to start misgendering me; medical professionals are especially grievous offenders, because you tend to think too highly of yourselves and your narrow educations.

People have mentioned medications on here, but many of these medications actually interact with hormone levels. I may have been born with a male sex, but I have been hormonally female for three and a half years. My cells have all adapted to female hormone levels and operate in an estrogen-dominated mode. If I have an \"M\" on my information, and you give me a medication that reacts badly to high estrogen levels, you're going to severely hurt me. \n\nAnd let's look at cancer risk. At this point I have zero chance of getting testicular or penile cancer. After years of bathing in female hormones, my chance of getting prostate cancer is and will remain almost zero. Now I can't get ovarian, uterine, or cervical cancer, my risk for breast cancer is similar to that of cisgender women.\n\nAnd finally, you mention that I won't be able to get pregnant, and this is true. However, when it comes time to have children, it is my hope that I'll be able to breastfeed. This is in many cases possible, and it is a connection I really hope to have with my children when the time comes.\n\nIn summary, the idea that trans people's sex is not so simple.

    "chosen": "Hourly employees, who are paid based on the time spent working, aren't usually given paid vacation, and sick days are only common at higher pay grades. They do usually get overtime pay as an incentive to stick to projects when they need to be done.\n\nSalaried employees, who are paid based on level of work completed, a subjective negotiated rate, generally are afforded paid time off. The reason for this is that the amount they are paid isn't directly tied to the time they spend working.\n\nSalaried employees are expected to be ready to give up time and other plans when the workload gets heavy, and plan vacations to minimize the disruption to work. They may take on-call rotations where they effectively have to be ready to work at a moment's notice. For this, they receive no extra pay, but also can take a large amount of vacation time in a single chunk without worrying about their monthly income taking a hit.\n\nIf companies wished to avoid paid vacation, salaried employees would likely demand extra pay for an overtime, which they do a lot of. The company usually comes out ahead with a vacation day policy.\n\nSick leave is a different story. A sick employee isn't as productive as a healthy employee, and could make mistakes. An employee with a communicable illness could spread this loss of productivity to others within the company. With non-communicable illnesses, is is relatively likely that a sick employee's life is at risk, and the loss of the employee requires training a replacement.\n\nThe company is better off if the sick employee just stays home. However, the employee wants to get paid or save their vacation for when they are healthy, and may avoid alerting the company to their illness in order to ensure they get to work. Paid sick days remove this incentive so that the employee will focus on recovering instead.",
    "rejected": "Let's look at it in terms of two different sets of people: white collar workers and low-skill + blue collar. It's not everyone, but it's a good foundation to look at. \n\nWhite collar workers generally have paid sick or vacation days. If you're a business, you want to give them this for the same reason why you give them things like free shuttles to work, gym benefits, and other perks. There's a limited supply of talent and you need to do what you can to attract the best kind.\n\nFor more low-skill workers, they'd have to be lucky to find jobs that offer things like paid sick leave or paid vacations. From a productivity standpoint, it may be better to offer such things. Humans are not automatons. They need time to refresh. And there's no need to have a bug spreading around the workplace making more of your workers unproductive.\n\nThat's a pragmatic perspective. The moral perspective is you do it because it's the societally right thing to do — much like the concept of minimum wage. \n\nWhy should governments decide how much companies can pay workers? Why not market value? Well, because a lot of people can't live off of \"market value\". Just because there are people who'd be willing to work below minimum wage doesn't mean that we should look to that as some ideal. \n\nA lot of workers would take a job without proper safety equipment but that's clearly not something we want as a norm in our country.\n\nVacations aren't long. They really aren't. We should offer these things because we as a country should have moral standards (the USA currently does not make either mandated by law).

While I agree with you that 99% of the time, it's within your control if you're overweight or not, there is a difference between obesity and, say, not showering.\n\nFor example, consider this: When I was in the military, we had this guy in one of my platoons who would not shower. Living in the barracks, we all suffered but particularly his roommates. Eventually, some of the guys in my platoon decided they had had enough and they \"fixed\" his problem. It was not a pleasant experience for anyone, particularly him. But, after that, he showered everyday. Problem solved. Maybe it wasn't right that he was shamed (and borderline assaulted) but it worked.\n\nWe also had some fatties. There was no dragging them to the back of the barracks and spraying them with a skinny hose. It was a much more long term problem and while it may have been their fault, it's a much harder problem to fix. While some fat people might respond well to being shamed into exercising and eating better, a lot of them won't. That kind of treatment will really just perpetuate their problem and make it harder to deal with.\n\nOn another note, you didn't mention anything about age. I assume you're referring strictly to adults but on the off chance you aren't, kids don't need any more bullying and a lot of them really aren't in a position to change their diets or activity level. Parent shaming (who are most likely also fat) would be a more defensible position.\n\n**TL;DR**: Not showering or wearing deodorant? Easy, immediate fix. Anyone who doesn't do it doesn't respect the people around them.  Being overweight is a much harder obstacle to tackle. If there's any lack of respect, it's not for other people, it's for themselves.

It takes monumental effort for me to maintain my size and shape, but I put in that effort. I make sacrifices in food intake. I refuse free food at work constantly because I know that I can't afford to eat it.\n\nI spend literally 6 hours a week at a boxing gym and do 1-2 hours a week of additional physical activity. I have a desk job and can't do any physical activity at work. This means that my 7-8 hours a week of exercise comes during my free time. \n\nThe point I'm making is that as adults, people have choices to make.

So I don't think you're alone, but I think perhaps you're assuming that had the American backed South won, these problems would be fixed. I know you said the North was corrupt, but the South was every bit as corrupt. They probably wouldn't have been able to support the economy any better, and depressions and famine may have ensued anyway, albeit they may get support from the US. Remember that a significant number of Vietcong in the South were southerners who were disillusioned with the corruption of the government. So they in effect fueled quite a lot of backlash against themselves. I'd also point out that the government was rather unstable, as seen in the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. If there was that much turnover, there could potentially be wars in the future over other rival factions or even communist resurgence or a probable and continual insurgency. So there's a significant potential that more Vietnamese would die in the coming years than the already horrible toll paid. Also, if the DRVN won the war, I highly doubt they'd be able to solve the border dispute between Vietnam and China considering those countries have been at odds for centuries if I'm not mistaken. My point here is that unfortunately the choice between a good government and a bad government appears to have been an illusion, and while unfortunately the current government isn't good, I guess you might say it's \"the devil you know\", considering things could have gone worse.",
    "rejected": "1) Do you know how brutal, corrupt, and undemocratic South Vietnam is? Ngô Đình Diệm isn't democratically elected, instead he was assumed the presidency by the American to a country largely make up by the remnant of French imperialism (a puppet state). He's also not popular either, remember Vietnam supposed to be unified in 1954 after Điện Biên Phủ, and supposed to hold democratic election in 1956 as a result of the Geneva Accord... Guess who would have won that if it is actually held? That's right, Hồ Chí Minh had the overwhelming support of the nation. Not because he is a communist/socialist figure, but rather a NATIONALIST one\n\nBack to the period of Diem's rule, the government is largely consist of his family members holding key positions (gia dình tr). Also, there are huge oppression toward the Bhuddism commnunity, led to the self-immolation of some certain Bhuddist monk that you should know. Also, there were many wrongful incarceration/execution of people who are suspected to be Communists or spy from the North. Likewise, villagers are force to move into camps/fortresses to avert any uprising... These policies causing lots of oppositions from the people and thus Diem was murdered.. What happened after that was a two-year spans of political instability, and the country couldn't even control itself... Hence, the Americans forces had to involve, which coincide with Nguyen Van Thieu's rule (and he's merely a puppet in a gov't whose policies were largely dictated by the Americans)...\n\nMy point is that how could a government that unstable could actually controlled Vietnam. Lacking of integrity from the interior and strength to cope with outside forces... The result of the War largely reflects the nature of South Vietnam, a mere puppet state which shouldn't be there at first place \n\n2) You think that the American wanted the best for us? Well, do you understand the nature of the Cold War, a global-scale tension which Vietnam was reluctantly dragged into. Most Vietnamese couldn't associated their War within the Cold War concept, virtually because we're from the \"hottest\" spot, which overshadowed the Cold War itself. My point is the US had their own interest to stop the power of the USSR, thus they called \"spread of Communism\", and they went radical about it. Many democratic elected  socialist leaders were overthrow by the US army and replaced by anti-communism despot, most notably in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) or [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). (Different circumstance but don't forget [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee)). Vietnam War shared the same nature with these but much more intensify because of the [Domino Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory)\n\n3) About OP &amp; Vietnam: ~~You're part of the bandwagon who want to gaze war with China to demand the islands back. How ignorance you are!~~ This is not XII century when you could easily declare war upon one another. If we do attack China, not will we suffer their reprimand, but will receive criticism around the world. Diplomacy is the key, stronger collaboration between ASEAN and the US forces would keep the Chinese in the current place. \n\nI can't believe you despise the Vietnamese gov't because of Communism. It's a fail economic model that Vietnam got rid of in 1986. The party retain the name for historical reason, and more importantly, its nature is NATIONALIST, and a political platform for all people. [One-party system is totally democratic if you keep different opinions among its memebers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOsjSKKPWMc). If you think multi-party platform could work in Vietnam, then consider what happen in South Vietnam during the war, and how they set up a dictatorship after. \n\nYou should remember that Vietnam is war-free in 1989, so its economy has short time to recover and develop. Compare Vietnam economy to Korea's and Japan's one disregard circumstances is just compare apple to orange. Remember that the war would be completely averted in [1945](http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=228) and [1954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conference_%281954%29).

    "chosen": "I'm going to speak anecdotally here. I had similar feelings about antidepressants (specifically SSRIs) for a very long time. Then I started to struggle with OCD. I didn't know what was wrong with me at first, but my doctor and I worked out a dosage of Zoloft that worked for me. If you don't know much about OCD, I was basically suffering from extreme bouts of anxious thoughts that would in turn leave me depressed and almost unable to move. I felt bad/guilty about *everything*.\n\nI went on and off Zoloft a few times, and I tried different dosages as well. After a while, it did feel to me that the pills made everything a bit \"numb\" - so while I felt *better* for a time, I also didn't feel completely like myself. To clarify, they did not put me into \"happy land\" and make everything seem like sunshine and rainbows. They just made it easier for me *not to care* about the things that used to make me anxious or upset. However, the side effects were a little too much for me (this is an *individual* problem - not everyone experiences negative side effects). I made an effort to step down safely off the medication (with doctor supervision), and work on behavioral therapy techniques to combat my anxiety in the future.\n\nWhich leads me to my main point to you. It's easy when you've not taken antidepressants to look at them as a \"quick fix\" or a band-aid for your problems. But that's not how they work. They are more of a tool to pull you out of a negative feedback loop of anxiety and depression when you just cannot do it yourself. You also have to keep in mind that they tend not to work \"by themselves\". You should also see a therapist to help change your thought processes. There are many techniques you can learn that just involve changing your thinking pattern. It's really just training yourself to handle depressive/anxious thoughts in a constructive way.\n\nFor some people, anti-depressants are only a temporary solution, and they can eventually stop taking them. For other people, it's a lot easier to slip back into old patterns when they are not taking medication. And that *okay*; people are different, they have different bodies, and they require different tools to manage their illness. But taking an antidepressant is no less valid than using any other medication to manage any other illness.\n\nIt sounds like you are having a negative reaction to your friends' attitudes towards antidepressants, rather than the drugs themselves. I understand where you're coming from. Please just recognize that you can adopt a healthier and more constructive approach to managing your treatment. Best of luck in the future - I hope you find a therapist and treatment option that work for you.",

It's not as if you feel happy all the time, but it allows you to be able to feel happy at all.\n\nDepression isn't always prolonged melancholy--the most debilitating part of depression, I've found, is not finding any joy in anything.

Also, get a diagnosis from a therapist or psychiatrist before you say: \"I've been depressed.\"  Depressed isn't a feeling, it's a state of mind and it's much more debilitating than just feeling sad.  It's extremely complex and taking a 10-point quiz online does not qualify you to say whether you're depressed or not.\n\nWhen you have to make the decision between feeling like a pile of shit and watching your life flow down the drain and taking a pill every day or every other day, the choice will become crystal clear.  It's not an end-all-be-all--a lot of times, there's a reason you're depressed, but being unstuck by anti-depressants at least allows you to be able to work towards solving those issues.  "

    "prompt": "I believe the US party system has devolved into an \"us vs them\" mentality between the two major parties and prohibits any progress from being made in society.",
    "chosen": "I'll argue on your point that the U.S. government has *devolved* in this mentality.\n\nThe U.S. government system is like this by design. The two major parties of each era have always been at odds with each other. From the Founders' intent perspective, we get this line from the Federalist Papers, \"ambition versus ambition\". The Founders envisioned an inherently adversarial system of governance as opposed to the unilateral, monarchical rule that they were accustomed to. Sudden, arbitrary, unilateral change was the enemy to them. Their objective was for any substantial change to be gradual, going across multiple election cycles.\n\nFor a breakdown of the mechanics of how they achieved this, CGPGrey did an excellent analysis of why third parties can't win which by necessity breaks down how the U.S. election system works (don't have the link handy). I'll summarize by simply pointing out that at the national level, our representatives can seem uncompromising because of the closed primary system, which they must navigate to secure their nominations for a particular position. This is why you'll often see presidential candidates flip-flop going into the general election after they get their party's nomination; they have to \"posture\" themselves to two completely different demographics.\n\nI'm not saying this is a justification, but it's important to understand that there are systemic reasons for the state of U.S. politics.\n\nNow, the psychology of politics is something you've gotta consider. Your proposition to do away with parties entirely is, if not unwise, at least impractical. The tendency towards to self-selection and group mentalities means that parties will inevitably pop up. The best we can do would perhaps be to rework our election system so that alternative parties are more viable. You also shouldn't underestimate the degree to which voters use party identification as a cognitive shortcut. This phenomenon is so powerful that I would recommend the polar opposite of your preference with a proportional voting system, where people vote for their preferred party and seats within the legislature are distributed according to the proportion of votes for each party.\n\nParties are also useful because they provide cognitive shortcuts for representatives as well. By that, I mean that each party can have a common platform for each policy area, while individual members can specialize in particular policy areas and have strong beliefs and values on the issues they or their constituents care about, while being \"rank and file\" supporters for their party's general policy agenda.\n\nNow as far as the specific policy issue of net neutrality, I would like to point out that there are legitimate criticisms of the current proposal that are compelling in light of the post-Snowden era. Of course, that doesn't change the fact that the prominent Republican criticisms of it rely on ad hominem arguments to oppose legitimately problematic policies (that they would, in all actuality, probably be okay with if their guy was in the White House). Ever since 2010 we've seen this kind of political posturing against the Obama administration, and while that campaign has been intellectually dishonest and very damaging in some ways, it's important to acknowledge and respect this persistent proportion of Americans who are genuinely *not okay* with the direction that the country is going. While the individual arguments they may articulate on any given issue can come across as fallacious, there's an underlying cognitive shortcut in their opposition that stems from the fact that they disagree with the principles that President Obama and the Democratic Party use to justify their policies. RE: big government v. small government, military policy aside. The anti-Obama coalition within Congress and the media is really just the disadvantaged side in the current political climate trying to gain leverage against the majority; it's an intellectually dishonest strategy, but a concise strategy nonetheless.\n\nThis goes, somewhat, with what the Founders meant by \"the tyranny of the majority\". Just as a nation should not be unilaterally ruled by a king, it should also not be ruled by a simple majority of people. The solution they proposed was that every major policy be a compromise, where neither side really gets what they want. But when we're not left with the situation where someone can be considered three-fifths of a person, our simple-majority election system sometimes results in one side getting everything they want while the other 49% don't get anything, and that can breed a lot of hatred and frustration in people.",
    "rejected": "I don't think many people would disagree that the two party system doesn't represent the beliefs of most people in America. The main issue is how to change it.\n\nThe first step for this is figuring out what you want to change about the system. Do you want people to vote based on personal ideology instead of party? Most elections only have 1 to 3 candidates to choice from. You could say more politicians need to run, but that require a lot of time and money from people who have no shot at winning. To win most elections, a politician needs 50% of the vote to win. If you have more than 2 parties legitimately competing, this becomes very hard to do. If no one gets the majority, the election goes to a runoff between the top two choices. This means if there are two left leaning parties, and five right leaning parties, there is about a 100% chance the left will win. This systematic problem means it it more beneficial to have few parties you agree with and many that you don't.\nBecause of the above mentioned problems, it becomes clear that a legal change would be needed to fix the system. FPTP (first past the post) voting would need to be legally abolished by every local and state government in order to allow for third parties to become stronger. Now the question becomes what do you replace it with. Do we just scrap local elections in favor of a general proportional party election? That would be a tough sell, as most people at least like to feel that they are voting for a person, not a party. CGP Grey has several good videos about the topic that I will link to at the bottom of this reply. He suggests many different alternatives, but my favorite is STV (single transferable vote) which I'll let him explain. \n\nNow we have decided what we want to do to change the system, but we have no idea how to do it. The legislators in DC will almost certainly never amend the constitution to limit their own power, and the states are only slightly more likely to do it. The only way it is ever likely to happen is via ballot initiative which several states do not have. For federal level offices, such as the president, senate, and the house, state level initiatives may not be able to stand. The only way to change those elections is through an amendment, so you would need 75% of the states want to implement your proposal which would be very difficult because no one in power now would benefit from the change.\n\nMy basic point is this. While most people will likely agree that the current system is not good, there is basically no chance that it will ever change, because those in power want to stay in power.\n\nEdit: Forgot the link\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7679C7ACE93A5638"

You feel pain, because you miss the pleasure.\n\nIt's the same thing with a cluster headache. You underrate the good feeling of having a clear head and feeling \"normal\". Cluster headaches hurt so much because normal feelings are so good. With normal feelings in your head, you can come up with amazing ideas, formulas, etc that make you feel immense joy. You take that for granted.\n\n&gt; #4 The universe doesn't care about how we feel. No one is protecting us. If I'm falling onto spikes, universe is not gonna pull me away and protect me, no matter how hard I pray.\n\nThe universe is not some sentient being with feelings. Saying that the universe doesn't care about you falling onto spikes is the same as saying the playground didn't care that you broke your arm while on the slide. The universe doesn't have feelings. Dying is a part of life. It is the equal to birth. Birth is the best thing that can happen to you and death is the worst.

    "prompt": "Darth Vader is beyond redemption.",
    "chosen": "When we say that vader redeemed himself, it doesn't mean that killing the emperor and sacrificing himself made up for all the terrible things he did. What did happen was, in that moment vader understood that what he had done was truly wrong, and that he needed to change. And he did. He sacrificed himself and died a good person, albeit one who had done terrible things. \n\nPeople are not defined by their past, at least not exclusively. They are also defined by their present (what they are doing now) and their future (what they intend to do). And so the fact that vader did unforgivable things does not mean that vader couldn't end up being a good person again. However, it does mean that vader had a debt to society that he could never come close to fully repaying. But, having become a good person, he did his best to repay that debt, by sacrificing his life to save his son. \n\nI suppose the long and the short of it is forgiveness=/=redemption. Vader could be redeemed without being forgiven. We know, and vader knew, that he couldn't make things right. But we also know that, at least for the last minutes of his life, vader would do anything in his power to right as many of those wrongs had he could. And that's why he died a good person.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that the force complicates this issue. In the real world it's hard to imagine someone truly and honestly changing from serious evil to truly good at all, let alone as rapidly as vader did. But the force can help us to explain vaders transition. The force, specifically the dark side, is like a drug. Only while most real world drugs merely make you stupid, the dark side makes you evil. Evil people don't simply use the dark side, the very use of the dark side makes them more evil, creating this positive feedback loop of hate and anger and lust for power. Anakin is too blame for falling into this cycle, just as a drunk driver is responsible for crashes when drunk. Let's run with this analogy. A drunk driver may have done something truly unforgivable, but they can still redeem themselves. Specifically, they could stop drinking, and do good deeds to atone for their sins. Even if they can't repay that debt, they would be for trying their best. When anakin breaks free of the dark side, it's too late for his actions to be forgiven, but it's never too late for redemption. \n\nNothing vader could do would forgive his sins, but he'd do anything to make them better, and that's what made him a good person at the very end. ",
    "rejected": "I think it's absurd to assert that there is some arbitrary line beyond which a person cannot redeem themselves. Redemption is not a matter of outweighing your past bad acts with good acts, morality does not work that way. You can't purchase being a good person with good deeds. Redemption comes from an internal change, rather than external acts. It comes from seeing that what you did was wrong, and changing who you are. Redemption isn't about covering up the past, it's about changing the future."

Keep in mind that the media didn't release pictures of him right away because the media firestorm actually only occurred some time after Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin.  The outrage was a result, at least in part, of how the media chose to portray that event. They knew that Zimmerman's \"whiteness\" created a simpler, more \"compelling\" narrative.

    "prompt": "People who are against same sex marriage are practicing religious intolerance and if you are for allowing civil unions, the government should not call them marriages for straight people and civil unions for gay people.",
    "chosen": "So, while many have argued for the position whereby marriage is not an institution recognized by the government, I will take a slightly different approach to arguing for that position.\n\nLet's start with the crux of the issue: currently where same sex marriage is not legally recognized, those couples that would otherwise be legally married are not entitled to the same legal benefits as heterosexual married couples.  This extends usually even to civil unions which are not guaranteed all of the same protections, benefits and privileges.  \n\nPart of the debate is that homosexual marriages should be treated exactly as heterosexual marriages.  The position that no marriage should be legally recognized accommodates this.  The other part of the debate is what protections, benefits and privileges should be extended to married couples.\n\nMarriage, even as a legally unrecognized institution, incentivizes itself.  As a married person you are engage in life's challenges with a partner to help you through them.  You have someone you are committed to love and someone who is committed to love you.  With that alone, it's a pretty good deal.\n\nBut there is your question of why would it be okay to create a law that specifically creates inequality?  *Any* marriage law clearly does just this.  It creates a special legal class for those who are married.  Specifically, it creates a special legal class of people who are given extra privileges, protections and benefits.  So, people who already have the benefit of having someone love them enough to marry them  are given extra privileges, protections and benefits over those unlucky enough to find no such person.  Nothing could be more clearly inequal.\n\nTake with this, too, some of the numbers going with this.  In the US, approximately 2-3% of the population are homosexual while around 20% of the population will never marry.  Given that also probably 20% of that 2-3% that are homosexual will never marry either, you *really* think there can be no secular way to disagree with giving extra legal privileges, protections and benefits only to those lucky enough to find someone who loves them enough to marry them at the expense of those who do not?",
    "rejected": "People are divorcing has done more to cheapen the idea of marriage more than anything.\n\nIf the government will sanction same sex marriage and give certain benefits and protections to people because of such, they HAVE TO do it for gay people. No one has the right to deny a service provided by the government to another person.\n\nThese religious wack jobs have had a grip on our government for too long, the few that there are, or the many, they are wrong, who cares what words they use to define a legal protection between two people. \n\nIf religious people press the idea that straight people are the only people who should be allow to get married, well, no one should at that point if they will not relent."

    "prompt": "Alcohol is bad, please don't let me grow up boring",
    "chosen": "&gt;convince me that alcohol isn't bad.\n\nThis is vague.  What precisely do you mean when you say that alcohol is \"bad.\"  I'll assume that whe you say it is bad, what you mean is \"I shouldn't drink alcohol.\"\n\nWhile I'm not personally a huge drinker of alcohol, I think I can convince you that should sometimes drink it. \n\nThe first thing to point out is that if you have only a little (~1 beer), it will not have much of an effect on you.  You might notice a small effect if you've never had it before, but you might not even notice it. In my experience, the effect of drinking one beer is probably comparable to the effect of eating one dose of chewable Tylenol. Maybe even less noticeable than that.\n\nYou might respond by asking \"Why should I drink something that will have no appreciable effect on me?\" The answer is, unfortunately, that sometimes you will be in situations (e.g. parties) where abstaining might bring attention onto you that you don't want. If you have a single drink and say that you've had enough after that, it will be decidedly less awkward. So this might mean you should drink in those situations. (Personally, I've gotten to the point where I no longer will have a drink just to fit in, but when I was 16, or 18, or 20, I definitely would do this.)\n\nBut what about having more than one drink? Well, clearly you should take things one step at a time (and from your description of yourself, I don't expect that you'd go out and do 10 shots this evening). But some people, many people in fact, quite like the feeling of being somewhat 'drunk.' It can make you more relaxed, more social. Some people who have social anxieties find that alcohol helps them to come out of their shell when they are with groups of people.\n\nIn sum, alcohol *is* bad in some ways, and it can be dangerous. But other times, it can be relatively benign, and in some situations, it can even be good!",
    "rejected": "Well, you might want to try explaining why you think alcohol is bad in a little more detail, as I don't really have much to go off of here.\n\nBasically, alcohol in moderation is a tool for making certain experiences more enjoyable.  There are different levels of intoxication.  It's not like there's a threshold you cross where you go from coherent and coordinated to stumbling baboon.  You can drink slowly and in moderation over the course of a night and just get enough alcohol in your system to have a \"Buzz\" going.  It lowers your inhibitions enough to make you more talkative, so social situations are either more fun, or easier to stomach depending on your point of view.  It produces a unique feeling which is enjoyable, so even if you're just watching Breaking Bad or reading a book by yourself it's still a fun activity.\n\nYou're 16, so I'm not going to recommend you start drinking, that's against the law, but alcohol isn't really something to be fearful of.  When you understand the effects of alcohol, if you're **responsible** about when you drink and how much you have, it is simply a tool to help you have a good time."

Macs on the other hand, have gone through 30 years of product adjusting and cycling and know what will appeal to the vast majority of the population. \n\n\n",
    "rejected": "I'm not going to try and change your view so much as offer an alternative perspective on the whole matter. As a disclaimer, I'm pretty solidly in the apple camp and have been for about 8 years.  Mostly because I do a good bit of what some might call \"creative\" work. I jumped to Apple back when it was the only option for software that I wanted to use. Currently using a 2010 MacBook Pro which (will eventually be replaced either by another 15\" Retina MBP or 13\" Air), iPhone, and I have an iPad 2 that I rarely use. All of that said, I have no problems with non-apple products.\n\n&gt;The Surface Pro 3 is lighter than an 11\" or 13\" MacBook Air and iPad Air 2 combined.\n\nEh, I realize that some people really care about this, but for me, I honestly wouldn't notice the difference that a few ounces make. In the grand scheme of things, would you? I'm not talking like pick up one bag with Macbook + iPad and then immediately put it down and pick up the Surface Pro bag. Then you'd notice. What I mean is, if it is your daily carry, a few ounces don't matter much. Kinda the same idea as going to Best Buy or wherever to look at a new TV. Sure, look at them side by side and you'l see a difference, but get one home and into your living room? It doesn't matter so much.\n\n&gt;The Surface Pro 3 has a pen, which both lack (Apple's strategy is to have excellent touch input). Pen input helps with notes for those who prefer writing, and those who use CAD programs.\n\nI've always struggled a bit with pen input. I really don't see a need for it with the way I use computing devices day-to-day. I'm not in school any longer (gradated college in 2010), and i could see an argument for note taking, particularly with stuff thats difficult to input on a keyboard, but then again, I always prefer taking notes on real paper. Call me old fashioned if you want, but there are dozens of us, DOZENS!\n\n If I were a graphic artist and needed a pen for CAD stuff, I wouldn't be bothering with a pen input built into a phablet. I'd do that work with a real external pad.\n\n&gt;The MacBook Air uses relatively outdated technology to keep battery life long (take a look at the screen!)\n\nHonestly don't know enough about the screen on either device\n\n&gt;Most people I know use touchscreen laptops because they're more convenient.\n\nI just disagree. If I'm sitting at a desk using a computer and keyboard, I want to be able to control the computer with my arms resting. Poking at the screen and lifting my arms up all the time is just tiring. Plus, a good track pad like on the Macbooks is way more precise than a stubby finger anyway.\n\n&gt;The iPad Air 2 is not a reasonable productivity device (however, it's common to see students on my campus with just iPads and poor-quality keyboards attached). It's really a plaything.\n\nNo argument here. But then again, I'd argue that only a full-fledged notebook is a true productivity device. Tablets, and hybrids really fall short in many respects, particularly with smooth multitasking and displaying data from different applications simultaneously.\n\n&gt;MacBooks have a stranglehold on the campus because the student store is aggressively promoting them. However, I have recently seen numerous students switch to Surface for their needs, especially since Microsoft has begun promoting Surface on campus.\n\nNot sure what this has to do with the superiority of either device, honestly. Though I could make the argument that more people buy Apple computers because they feel it suits their needs better.\n\n&gt;If the Windows 10 hype follows through, then Microsoft products will experience a new wave of adoption, including the next generation of Surface.\n\nAgain, not really point in favor of MS or against Apple. Just speculation. \n\nIn general, consumers are driven to buy what they feel works best for them. Marketing plays a big role in that. But if a product fails to deliver on marketing promises, consumers won't come back.\n\nSo basically, the Surface Pro approach works for you. It has the features that matter most to you. But what you value/need in a computing device isn't necessarily what other people value/need in theirs. "

    "prompt": "I feel like Superman is the most Mary Sueish hero, and I do not understand his popularity. CMV.",
    "chosen": "Let me explain it this way:\n\nPerhaps you're thinking of Superheroes too narrowly. Perhaps you're thinking that most Superhero stories go along the lines of this: Bad guy appears, Superhero beats bad guy.\n\nThat's just about the most boring storyline structure ever. And that's the problem with your analysis: you think that a Superhero is defined by how he fights the bad guy.\n\nLet me present you an alternative view of why Superman is so appealing: He is our fantasy of justice. He's our fantasy answering the question: What if \"good\" were endowed with Superpowers?\n\nGiven all the evil and terrible things in the world we live in, *what if* there were some really good guy that represents all our greatest hopes for humanity, with Superpowers that can put *everything* right.\n\nGrant Morrison put it in a much better way than I ever could:\n&gt;So we chose not to deconstruct the superhero but to take him at face value, as a fiction that was trying to tell us something wonderful about ourselves. Somewhere, in our darkest night, we made up the story of a man who will never let us down [...]\n\n&gt;Because it all derived from Superman. I mean, I love all the characters, but Superman is just this perfect human pop-culture distillation of a really basic idea. He's a good guy. He loves us. He will not stop in defending us. How beautiful is that? He's like a sci-fi Jesus. He'll never let you down. And only in fiction can that guy actually exist, because real guys will always let you down one way or another. We actually made up an idea that beautiful. That's just cool to me. We made a little paper universe where all of the above is true.\n\nWe don't want to see Superman struggle (physically). We want to see him win. We want to see him save people, smile, and fly off to solve some other problem. We want to see him beat the crap out of evil aliens, and effortlessly round up the most dangerous of criminals. We want to see good triumph over evil.\n\nSuperman is basically Jesus. He's God in the sense of omnipotence and in the sense of the greatest good, having just enough humanity to connect and make sense to us. That last bit is really important: the fact that deep down, he's just good ol' Clark Kent, raised on the farm with the best of parents, wants to help everyone, and *just happens to have superpowers* reminds us that we have that goodness within us. Humanity is also capable of that level of good and charity.\n\nSo, now that we've established that Superman is no ordinary Superhero, let's answer your question: What makes an interesting Superman story.\n\nThe answer is: not one where he can beat the bad guy physically.\n\nI'll give you an example.\nIn Red Son: Superman is raised in Soviet Russia instead of America, and basically tries to altruistically take over the world and spread communism. [spoiler]And he easily does so. He restrains himself as he hopes that people will realize how much better Communism is (as ruled by an altrustic Superman), but over time he decides he just needs to take the reins, until Lex forces him to realize that he's basically playing god and humanity no longer has any agency. He ultimately realizes that he must let humanity choose its own way.[/spoiler]\n\nAlternatively, \"Luthor\" is a pretty good Superman story too. Except it barely even stars Superman saving the day. It revolves around Luthor's genuine fear that Superman, in being this godlike figure on Earth, completely cripples mankind's ability to progress because they see this *alien*, faster, stronger, more capable than they'll *ever* be, and there's nothing left for them to do. Luthor and Superman represent two different ideals of humanity. Superman vs. the Ubermensch (Lex). Whereas Luthor represents the peak capability of humanity (Lex is at peak human intelligence and presumably physical training, at the forefront of business, technology and politics, and a complete master of his own fate), Superman represents the greatest good in humanity (accentuated by the fact that he has godly powers but uses them altruistically). \n\nNow, what's a bad Superman story? I don't know, the Death of Superman or something. Oh look, it's Superman, fighting this monster that's stronger than Superman. Greaaaat storyline guys.\n\nIf you want to read a story about a guy with gadgets or some cool power fighting cool villains, look elsewhere, at Batman or Green Lantern of Iron Man or something. Superman is much more endearing and enduring because he's now about fights and monsters, he's about the grand vision and greatest hopes of humanity. In his best stories, you walk away believing that some great moral principle has been won (or lost, depending on the story).\n\ntl;dr: Superman isn't your generic Superhero, who just needs to fight a bad guy and save the day. He's better thought of as a concept. And his best comics don't involve Superhero fighting Supervillain, they involve the ideas behind Superman and the ideas behind his villain clashing.",

Just like all the animals and trees, even as far as planets and stars.  Everything that *is*, will become *was*.\n\nYou nor I, nor every other living thing did not decide to want to be born and given life and make something of it.  It wasn't a phase that we wanted to do, like selecting your major in college or choosing to move to a new city.  Life sort of....just happened.\n\nI too have thought about this same question / statement as you have and I would totally agree with you, except on one point.  There is actually a reason for us being alive, the same reason as to why everything else is alive...and that is to breed, carry and pass on its species, whether it be a human or an apple tree.  \n\nEvery living thing is designed to be able to evolve, survive, and multiply.  Think of how every plant and every insect is designed biologically...its sole purpose is to survive and multiply.\n\nBut anyone can argue that we are over-populated, we may have the upper hand now against all predators, but we still haven't gotten the upper hand against time itself.\n\nIn case you were wondering and haven't figured out why I mentioned in my first sentence, \"If you think about it in the *stage of your life right now*\", it is me guessing that you do not have kids at the moment.  (I don't have any kids either btw), but I'm guessing when you have a kid, most people's goals shift from their own personal goals to that of their children.  They will do anything and spend all their time and energy to make sure their kids do well.  Now this is the case for MOST people I assume, and not everybody, hence the neglectful parents out there.\n\nIn my case, I don't plan or want to have children at all (I'm 29 right now), but because I don't plan on multiplying, that doesn't make life pointless.  It CAN be pointless if you want it to.  You could also make it the most important life in history if you also wanted to.  But there is no rule or law stating that you MUST have a good reason for living.\n\nYou are here now.  You are where you are in life right now, and it's all up to you on how you want to experience it.  There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to do it.  You can live it out by experiencing everything you've wanted to experience, you can live it out by traveling all the world, you can live it out being the parent of your child, you can live it out being someone's role model, you can live it out by living in a cave isolated.  It's all up to you.\n\nFor me, as selfish as it is, I want to experience all that I can before it's my time.  When else can you do it?  Yes, it'll all be erased from my mind after I cease to exist, but so what, I exist now and it brings joy to me.\n\nI kind of see life as a canvas, but not a blank one as another poster mentioned, but more of a canvas that comes with slow-drying paint splashed with different colors and patterns.  Those colors and patterns would be similar, but not the same, as to someone else born in similar surroundings as you (same town, school, city, country).  Given our assortment of paints and patterns, we can make whatever we want with what we have, even maybe borrowing from someone else's canvas or giving them something.\n\nSome people choose to make their canvas the most visually appealing as possible, where people will remember for forever what their canvas looked like.  Some people choose to make their canvas the most useful for other people's canvasses.  These are the ones that spend their time helping other people with their canvasses.  There are also people who choose to just have fun with their canvas without caring about how it looks like or functions in the end.  Some people set a certain structure of how to paint their canvas to their children, while some people aren't satisfied with their canvas, so they tell others not to follow the same pattern.  And sadly, some people choose to even destroy other people's canvasses.\n\nWhen we pass, our canvasses will be washed away.  But while we were making our canvas, we also have been intentionally or unintentionally painting on other people's canvasses.  It can a small dot, or even 80% of someone's canvas.  During the painting of your own canvas, someone else in your life has seen your canvas at the time, and it could have changed the way they were painting their canvas.\n\nIt's not the destination, it's the journey.

    "prompt": "I don't see the practical purpose of believing in privilege CMV",
    "chosen": "One of the reasons to recognize privilege and act accordingly is that sometimes acting the same way to people is not treating them the same.\n\nHere's an example. You're leaving work, it's already dark, and they still haven't installed the new lighting so things are just a bit dim. It's usually a safe part of town, but you're not going to run around carrying bags with dollar signs on them. You see someone else in the lot who is walking in a path that will cross yours. They turn to look at you.\n\nIs this person six inches and sixty pounds larger than you, probably but not certainly interested in you sexually, and doesn't seem to recognize how intimidating they are? That's what many women see. The vast, vast majority of men mean no harm and it's pretty common for men to not even realize how they can be intimidating. The trouble is that even if we're talking one in a thousand chance that the person she faces in that dark parking lot has any ill intention, she's in a much worse position on average to defend herself than a man would be. Whether it's sexual assault, robbery, or just some anti-social sort playing out scenes from A Clockwork Orange, a woman is going to feel more threatened by someone who is acting the exact same as they would act towards a man.\n\nRest assured that it is very possible to worry about one's privilege too much. You aren't out to apologize for all straight white men, nor are you expected to fix the world. You just help people live more equally when you recognize that a troublesome situation which can really bother you on the rare chance it happens to you may be frustratingly common for others.\n\nThat's one major chunk of privilege when you don't have to handle the same stressful situations every day. There's a lot more to it than that, but hopefully that example points out one of those cases where treating someone the same doesn't have equal results despite honest good intention.",
    "rejected": "Treating all people equally is still going to be a more favorable treatment for some than others if not everyone is coming in on equal footing.

What constitutes equal treatment? You might say 'selecting people for a job/college admission based on something objective like SAT scores' but those scores are racially slanted. Just comparing the numbers with no examination isn't fair."

Space - Freezer bottom refrigerators are generally wider and taller than freezer top.  Why?  Because of all the space the roller baskets take up on the sides and bottom of the freezer unit.  If kitchen space is a concern, or you care about maximizing the storage space you're paying to keep cold, freezer top is the way to go.\n\n3. Children, especially smaller children, are much less likely to be able to interact successfully with a freezer bottom than a freezer top.  The fridge, which they are much more likely to use, is out of reach.  While you do stipulate that \"most average-sized people\" find freezer tops cumbersome, I posit that small children are not uncommon, and allowing them to access the fridge without help may be worth whatever hassle using a freezer top is for a grown person.\n\nAlso, fridge and freezer may or may not be completely insulated from each other, but they're very well insulated from the outside.  Planning for a multi-day power outage in your appliance shopping seems unnecessary.",
    "rejected": "Top freezers are a simpler design. The way fridges are designed, all the cooling takes place in the freezer. There is a thermocouple in the fridge measuring the temperature. When the fridge reaches a certain temperature, a vent opens between the two compartments to let the cold air into the fridge section. If the freezer is on top, the air will flow freely downwards due to the denser cold air displacing the warmer air in the fridge. If the freezer is on the bottom, a fan is needed to drive the exchange. It will be more expensive to operate. \n\n\nThat being said, I have a bottom freezer and I find the convenience outweighs the extra cost."

Why would it try to generate so much publicity if it had such negative consequences (for ISIS)?\n\nI think these videos are uploaded because the more publicity ISIS gets, the more people it recruits. Not only that, but the more people that are outraged about ISIS, the more countries will pay ransom for hostages, and more funding for ISIS. People also (needlessly, in my view) vote more militarily oriented governments in under the threat of terrorism, and they act irrationally on that basis, by signing away their rights (as you can see from recent politics) etc.\n\nAs well as the above, most people that do watch these videos do so of morbid curiosity, or will find some pleasure in watching someone being executed, however much they try not to.

    "prompt": "I believe 9/11 was an inside job. CMV",
    "chosen": "Hi filthytom333. I don't have the time to go into all of the details, so let me attempt to change your mind in a different way. \n\nFirst off, I want to say that I don't think you're crazy or stupid for believing something like this. Let's be honest, our government has done some horrible things, and some the incidents that caused us to go to war have been of a questionable nature: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident\n\nWith that said, there is a tendency amongst people to take very complicated and confusing information for which no easy answers exist, and fit them into a framework that helps them make sense of the world. When it comes to issues of politics, war, and the economy, some of the more extreme folk will craft incredibly far-fetched answers that often involve shady, wealthy, back-room puppeteers who seem to pull the strings and have a hand in nearly every major catastrophe in the world. I'm sure you know where I'm going with this, but these are the people who are often called *conspiracy theorists*. \n\nNow I'm not instinctively opposed to whatever they say--if there is evidence, then let it be examined no matter how crazy of a conclusion it points to--but the problem with conspiracy theorists is that they operate like religious fundamentalists. They get themselves into a sort of logical loop by where any attempt to argue against them further reinforces their convictions. \n\nLet me explain. If I was to approach a religious fundamentalist (someone who mainstream religious folk would call crazy, or \"out there\") and try to convince them that perhaps God doesn't exist or that he does exist, but they're interpreting the Bible the wrong way, they would likely pull back further into their delusional, extreme thinking. After all, *of course I would try to convince them of otherwise, this is just their faith being tested*. The very fact that I'm trying to convince them of something else is seen as evidence that their beliefs are correct--for they knew that they would be challenged. My life has brought me in contact with some of these people, and I assure you that this is exactly what they do. \n\nConspiracy theorists operate in a similar manner. I also have a few friends who believe that stuff, and I just don't ever talk about it around them. If I argue with them, then I've \"drank the Kool-Aid\", or I need to \"open my eyes and start *thinking for myself*\", or \"I've been brainwashed by my culture and all of the giant corporations that want me to be their slave\". \n\nOn a certain level, I sympathize with these people. I understand the anger and feeling of helplessness. I used to work in Washington DC, I've been to some high-level, closed-door political strategy meetings, and I left politics with a bad taste in my mouth. There's some really fucked up shit happening, and good, average, every-day people are getting screwed over royally. I get it. \n\nBut once you go down the conspiracy theorist hole, it's a never-ending cycle of seeing some evil, all-powerful, boogyman around every corner. Just go to Infowars.com and see what I mean. Literally (and I mean literally) *every major incident* that happens is *blamed on a conspiracy* or given a *far-fetched, alternate explanation*. I once saw Alex Jones claim that the tornadoes which destroyed a town here in the United States may have been caused by a government weather machine. It just doesn't end, and sadly Infowars doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the paranoid talk that a conspiracy theorist can find convincing. Talk to some folks in the survivalist community if you want to see what I mean. \n\nBut back to your question, I have to place the 9/11 \"inside job\" hypothesis in the same category as other conspiracy theories. I'm not one of the guys who outright dismissed such claims--I'll give anything consideration as long as the evidence is there--but right now there is just too much speculation. Yes, there is some stuff that gives a person reason to pause and think \"what if\". Yes, there are some questions that do not have answers. But that's to be expected in such an unexpected event, and there are very, very few credible and serious individuals who put any stock in such claims. Besides, I find it laughable that the government could keep something like that a secret for over ten years. \n\nNow with that said, if documents come out in five or six years that implicate the government, or evidence starts mounting that points to something other than terrorists, then I'd be willing to give it a second chance. But right now, the only people who seem to be convinced by claims of an inside job are those who tend to engage in conspiratorial thinking. The major proponents of this idea are on *YouTube videos* with ominous music and narrators that are trying way too hard to scare the shit out of viewers. Like I said, I understand the motivations and concerns of people who are susceptible to this type of thinking, but sometimes you just have to accept that the world is far more complicated than evil corporations who try to subdue the people, Bohemian Grove meetings about how to turn John Q Public into a slave, and shadow governments comprised of billionaire elites who fund the politicians to pacify the people with republican vs democrat. While we're used to the day-to-day order and structure of living under a government, international relations largely takes place in anarchy. The relationships between nation-states are not governed by any larger body; it's a very, very complicated subject and it's not easily reduced down to the framework that's been accepted by your average Infowars viewer. \n\nSo, what do you think? Do you see any reason that this is *not* a conspiracy theory?\n\nBest of luck to you in the Navy, by the way!\n\n",

There are even people who claim that they clearly saw a missile, not a plane hit the Pentagon.\n\nThe nano-thermite is just complete bullshit, through and through. Not only would it simply not work, the \"study\" that claimed to find traces was a pile of garbage.\n\nThis site does a good job of explaining why it's nonsense: http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later/\n\n&gt;Both sides have produced compelling arguments...\n\nThe thing is, that the truthers really *haven't* produced compelling arguments. They've produced arguments that might sound compelling to laymen, but there really aren't any credible experts who see *anything* suspect about WTC 7's collapse.\n\nThe thing that really puts the nail in the coffin for 9/11 conspiracy theories is: what the fuck was the point of the whole thing? Was it necessary in order to go to war with Iraq? Fuck no, we already went to war with Iraq once, and we sure as hell didn't need a giant false flag attack to pull that off. Fabricating the attacks would have required *thousands* of people working on the inside, being complicit in the most enormous criminal act in the history of the government... you'd have to be completely insane to risk attempting to pull something like that off.\n\nHere's a more plausible story: With events like the bombing of the USS Cole bombing in 2000 in mind, the Bush administration felt that further Al Qaeda attacks might help to build support for the idea of military action in the middle east, and avoided acting on intelligence that could have helped them bring down Bin Laden or learn more about potential attacks. \n\nOf course, what they pictured was perhaps further attacks on US bases in the mid east, or at worst, a repeat of the 1993 WTC bombing (which left 6 people dead). \n\nWhat happened, though, was that the terrorists came up with a plan that's brilliance was how amateur it was. Truthers act like *there's no way* these guys could have pulled something like that off, which strikes me as ludicrous, they believe that the government is capable of faking the whole thing in a giant, extremely convoluted plan, but the idea of breaking into an airplane cockpit with box cutters and taking control of a plane is implausible? Sometimes there's also a faint air of racism in this incredulity... \"Of course a group of intelligent white men could orchestrate a giant terror hoax, but there's no way a bunch of brown guys could put together a plan to take down the WTC\". \n\nAirplanes have been hijacked hundreds of times, so that's hardly new, and the idea of using a plane as a weapon is pretty old too, dating back at least to kamikaze pilots, and probably earlier. Frankly, it's more surprising that nobody thought to do something like this earlier."

    "prompt": "What constitutes cinematography needs to be divided into two categories (\"classic\" and \"digital\") for the purposes of competitions/awards. CMV.",
    "chosen": "I did a few AC/DIT gigs on commercials and generally PA'ed around. My opinion is not fact and nor should I make out to say I know exactly what I'm talking about here... (DISCLAIMER) And I'm actually with you on wanting to separate the two as I was absolutely pissed when Life of Pi won.\n\n\n- First: About five years back, I argued that digital camera based movies should have different awards for film camera based movies. Simply because the skill required to do film (I mistakenly believed) was significantly harder. \n\n\nWhat I did realize that as time progressed and digital cameras like the Red and Epic came out, 4K made the lines between film quality and digital blur. Then again, when I was on set, the skill to bring out the best of digital required a different eye for lighting, camera movement, and general higher standards of quality (since dailies were easily viewable). It was then that I accepted, \"Yes, all cameras are equally difficult in cinematography.\"\n\n\n- Second: Your argument that \"classic\" (pure camera) should be separate from \"digital\" (digitally enhanced or CGI).  Aside from the fact that every frame that gets shot is either recolored, digitally modified to perform a certain way, or even CGI'ed a little, the classic style and digital style also require different skill sets. From a classic standpoint, you have to note the depth of field, lighting, and the million other little factors to get that shot. Yes, these factors make the magic in cinematography, but at the highest ends of cinematography (where they get nominated), there is less concern about these factors than simply image composition. They no longer worry about the factors that could hurt the image but only what can make that image beautiful. If the image is so stunning that it leaves you in awe, the cinematographer did the job right.\n\n\nLet me go back to my hatred for Life of Pi. Yes. I was pissed that it won, but then again, would I have been pissed if, let's say, Avengers got some award for camera work? Probably not. I thought it looks amazing and enjoyed every minute of it. That is until you realize that every shot was CGI. The buildings, the ships, the explosions, everything. The entire city is a CGI remodeling of New York. Then I looked back at Life of Pi. Yes, the colors were stunning and some scenes looked amazing- but still Life of Pi shouldn't have gotten the award for cinematography... and let me explain why.\n\n\nFor everything that Life of Pi did, it did to deserve that role. The camera angles and compositions were stunning enough to make, what is essentially a story about a kid and a tiger on a boat for two hours, entertaining. The fusion of storytelling, music, AND cinematography made it. There was something that was amiss that I realized why Life of Pi should not have gotten the award. Like I said before, everything in cinematography requires a certain skill or trait to make a scene beautiful. What makes Life of Pi a different skill than let's say Skyfall is where the cinematographer should be involved. Movies like Life of Pi should require the cinematographer to become an active part in the CGI/editing process rather than just a \"ok, I'm done\" mentality. Why? Because if the CGI doesn't pop, then the scene dies and if the scene dies, the cinematographer didn't do his job. \n\n\nThis gets me to my last point. The CGI was awful for large portions of the movie. Not just like, passable bad, but like the 1st Hobbit movie dragon + coin bad. Hell, even Finding Nemo's fish were more realistic than Life of Pi at some points. This is why I personally don't think Life of Pi deserves the cinematography role, but at the end of the day, it really is cinematography. Whether it is digital or classic, the cinematographer takes an active role in create an image out of nothing (one could argue even more so for digital). If you don't think digital cinematographers have it as hard, try imagining Skyfall where everything is CGI. It would be near impossible to replicate that movie. That movie was meant for classic style and any CGI would have ruined the world. Then imagine Life of Pi without any CGI. It would be the most boring movie in the world. While they have two different skill sets, they are equally breathing life into the concept of cinematography. ",

The cinematographer must still have a good handle on the art; 3D camera tracking won't transform an average cinematographer into a genius."

However, I do think we should, as much as possible, avoid causing harm that could result in extinction. \n\n2) Benefits to humans\n\nI agree, the ecosystem is not generally fragile as a whole; life can adapt to a variety of conditions. However, specific areas can have fragile ecosystems, in which animals and plants are codependent on each other for survival, and the removal of certain organisms (commonly known as keystone species) can have large impacts on other organisms. This means that plants or animals that we use as resources, such as medicinal plants, may be harmed if we try to eliminate a bug that helps it pollinate, something along those lines. It's in our best interest for diversity to exist, and be sustainable, so that we can use those resources to improve ourselves. By preventing the extinction of species through things such as poaching, over-farming (ex: buffalo), it makes it more practical to maintain and harvest resources.",

If we lose enough supporting species, it is possible that human life could end, and likely that humanity would be negatively impacted (by loss of food sources, sources of new drugs, etc). Life is intimately connected, and organisms directly and indirectly affect each other in many different ways. If you lose an entire species, you affect the species that fed on them or that they fed on, which affects others in all kinds of different ways. The ability of life to go on relatively smoothly is due to the biodiversity we have today, but as that diversity decreases, there are greater and greater chances of large impacts."

    "chosen": "Well, waste is one issue. Nuclear power plants still produce a pretty substantial amount of waste. This probably isn't relevant, since the \"waste\" (in the form of CO2) from fossil fuel power plants is pretty substantial, too. (EDIT: Though, honestly, this is still worth considering considering the nature of the waste. Originally, this read in a way that made the waste seem negligible, and I don't want it to!)\n\nTo an extent, fear is a problem as well - cold war attitudes still make people think that \"nuclear\" means \"extremely dangerous\", even when the technology has gotten much safer. This is very prevalent in America, from what I've seen. People know very little about nuclear power, but they know nuclear bombs almost ended the world.\n\nA big reason that we're not switching to nuclear power is cost. It's very expensive to switch from the energy sources we're using to nuclear power on a large scale.\n\nAnother big reason is jobs. Many people depend on the oil industry and etc. for work. (EDIT: Check /u/david12scht's post below! It's relevant and you should research economic impacts of technological shifts yourself, too. Still, while we're almost certainly going to be fine after the fossil fuel industry is gone, the fact it's here and providing jobs now *is* relevant as a why as outlined in this post.)\n\nWe don't use them more often because it's scary, expensive and too many people depend on fossil fuels to make their living.\n\nSo yes, we probably should use nuclear power more openly, but it's going to be a very slow process to get to that point because of how depedant we've become on fossil fuels *and* how nuclear power works, right now. These are some of the reasons that, *right now*, we can't.",
    "rejected": "Let me open by saying that I'm a big nuclear proponent.  It's an excellent source of power and has a pretty low failure rate compared to other methods of generating power.\n\nThat being said there are still two glaring flaws that we need to get over before becoming open about it.\n\n1.  What do we do with all that waste?  To a lesser extent, how do we ensure safety of said waste once it's removed from the facility?\n\n2.  How do we make sure that no nations or third parties use it for nefarious reasons?\n\nAs far as the first point, buying it out in the desert isn't good enough.  [Breeder reactors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor#Waste_reduction) can only chew it up so many times.  Eventually you're going to have all this waste that you can't really put anywhere.  So what do we do with it?\n\nTo sort of answer that question, you can assume that we'll replace Fission reactors with Fusion reactors.  And while it's still a possible solution to the waste problem it's still a long ways away from becoming commercially successful.  I do believe though that once it becomes a viable source of power that a lot of the nuclear scare crowd will disappear. \n\nAs far as the second point, well that's a bit trickier and I don't have an open solution to this.  And while I understand there is a fundamental difference between weapons grade and power grade nuclear material you still can't ignore the fact that power grade material is a stepping stone to weapons grade (in most cases) and power grade material by itself can be weaponized in the form of a dirty bomb.

    "chosen": "Of course one could take the view that all else equal, a society where the lion's share of unwanted births are prevented through contraception and sex ed to prevent unwanted pregnancies would be better than a society where the lion's share of unwanted births are prevented through pharmaceuticals or invasive surgery to abort unwanted pregnancies. This is in fact the view taken by just about every prominent proponent of abortion rights! After all, the name of the most prominent organization championing abortion rights isn't \"You Get An Abortion... You Get An Abortion... Everybody Gets An Abortion!\", it's \"Planned Parenthood\". The ideal society for these people would be one in which people are free to have recreational sex but the problem of unwanted pregnancy is largely nonexistent thanks to contraception and sex ed, with abortion available as a safe and legal option for the rare cases when an unwanted pregnancy does occur.\n\nThe reason this gets lost in the debate over reproductive rights, making supporters of reproductive rights appear to be \"pro-abortion\", is that all else is emphatically not equal. Arrayed in opposition to groups like Planned Parenthood is a powerful lobby according to which the root of the problem isn't necessarily unplanned parenthood or even the lives of \"unborn children\", but *sexual promiscuity*. The ideal society for these people is one in which sex only takes place in committed (i.e. married) relationships between people who are seeking (or at least willing) to have children. These people are also proponents of \"planned parenthood\" in a sense, but by their definition the very act of sex constitutes planning to be a parent, so abortion, sex ed, and contraception are all to be opposed by these people on roughly the same grounds: that they all acknowledge (or even encourage/incentivize) the use of sex for a purpose other than planned parenthood. In fact, the shaming of non-reproductive sex in these people's ideal society would also preclude (or at least discourage/disincentivize) the \"give birth -&gt; give child up for adoption\" route, since this would require potential abortion seekers to publicly acknowledge the unwanted pregnancy and accept the attendant shame. To the extent that exterminating recreational sex is an exercise in futility, abortions would still exist in such a society and probably at a rate much higher than in the ideal society of abortion rights supporters; they'd just be illegal and highly unsafe.\n\nSo no, in the real world fighting for abortion rights is important, because in the real world the vast majority of people fighting for abortion rights are fighting for exactly the society you claim to be seeking, and the vast majority of people fighting against them are fighting for exactly the society in which lack of abortion rights would do the most harm.",

For sex-ed advocates you are trying to make sure people are able to make responsible decisions and prevent STD's and unwanted pregnancies. Abortion rights advocates are fighting for a totally different concept, women's reproductive rights. \n\nYour premise is flawed because you are comparing apples to oranges. *Of course* someone who doesn't agree with abortion would think the other was more important.

All the mechanics were otherwise very similar.  You clicked to get around, you had abilities and levels, an item store, multiple lanes and towers, etc. But there was 3 teams somehow.\n\nAccording to ASSFAGGOTS, that would necessitate a new genre, since ASSFAGGOTS specifies that there are only two sides.  You would end up with all these genres that specify the number of teams they have, like ASSFAGGO3S and ASSFAGGOFS or ASSFAGGO4S, etc.\n\n\nFor that reason, ASSFAGGOTS is not the most fitting acryonym, because it's too restricting of the genre definition.\n\nASSFAG would be better.\n\n\n\nAnd even then, I'm not sure I've ever heard of a genre being named after a particular game/map, either.  You claim that other acronyms like MOBA and ARTS are too vague, etc., but including Aeon of Strife in the acronym is meaningless to anyone who's never heard of it (which is probably like 75%+ of the people who play games in this genre).\n\nSo now we remove that, too, and we just have FAG left, which is just as vague as MOBA and ARTS, in my opinion.\n\n\n\nAlso, some more inconsistencies in your argument.  You justify RPG by its history, yet deny that ARTS has a history.  By your own preferred acronym of ASSFAGGOTS, you reference the origins of the genre.  Modified gameplay of a RTS.  But ARTS doesn't just share the history of an RTS, it shares many mechanics, too.\n\nIn most Dota style games, you use your cursor to move around, determine who you'll attack, etc.  You use an overhead, birds-eye style view.  The matches are one-offs, with any character progress restarting at the beginning of a round.  Metagame is immensely important, whether it's build order or when to attack.\n\nSo just like RPG is a vague term defining a genre with a lot in common with its predecessor, so is ARTS.\n\n\n\nBut I don't think ARTS is necessarily the best term, because it implies the genre is restricted only to RTS-style games.  This would exclude games like Monday Night Combat, which would be a real shame, in my opinion.\n\n\n\nMy preferred acronym is MOBA.  You're right that it's certainly vague.  MOBA seems like it could include something like WoW battlegrounds.  But this is also true of plenty of genres.  Look at how many FPSs have RPG-esque qualities to them.  I mean, CoD lets me unlock guns and abilities, customize everything, etc.  That sounds like D&amp;D to me.  Battlefield even has classes.  I would never consider those games RPGs, though, because they fit better into the FPS category.\n\nSimilarly, MOBA *could* include card games and all sorts of other things, but those games each fit into another category better.  So when you filter out those games into other categories, you should basically just be left with Dota style games in the genre of MOBA.  That also makes sure you're not excluding games that try to do something new with the genre, like Monday Night Combat.\n\nI mean, action-adventure is a genre, so surely gamers aren't really that concerned with specificity.

    "prompt": "Police should be required to use dash cameras and wear body cameras at all times.",
    "chosen": "OK, I guess I’m going to write this one long diatribe and save it, rather than just re-writing it every 2 weeks and putting it into yet another body camera thread.\n\nPotential issues with body cameras:\n\n(1)\tFirst, we need to address the fact that, as of today, there isn’t a perfect body camera on the market. For a system to record an entire shift, it will have to meet the following standards:\n\na.\tArmored like a truck. Seriously. Body cameras will take just as much abuse as everything else an officer carries, and they have to be reliable.\n\nb.\tLightweight. Officers today already carry 25+ lbs of gear. Any significant addition of weight runs the risk of elimination via OSHA lawsuit.\n\nc.\tDependable. This goes along with armored, but more to the electronics side. They can’t fail. And if you think that this is an easy task, you need to think about the situations that officers encounter. They will have to work in snowstorms, at 30 below, in sandstorms, at 110, in driving rain, etc.\n\nd.\tBattery life. Some departments work 8’s, some work 10’s, and some work 12’s. And all of them have overtime at the end of a shift. So, to be safe, you’ve got to have 14 hours of battery life, minimum.\n\ne.\tStorage space. You’re going to have to have at least as much storage space as you have battery life. So, if you’ve got 14 hours of battery life, that means (assuming recording at SD [640x480, 30fps]} you need 1 MB/s, or 3.6 GB/hr, or 50.4 GB worth of space. To account for other things that have to live on that drive, call it 55 GB. And that’s for standard definition. \n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n(2)\tNow, let’s talk about cost. This is a complex discussion, because we have to address the initial startup costs as well as the ongoing maintenance costs. For the purposes of this discussion, let’s use the standard police department for a medium-sized city (100K citizens). This means you've got about 200 officers that work patrol, with 40 on duty at any given time. \n\nWe've already established that the product that’s necessary doesn’t exist on the market today, but let’s pretend it does. The going rate, at the moment, for the product that matches the ideal product is about $1,000, assuming you’re buying in bulk. To equip this department with sufficient cameras, you’re going to have to buy at least 60. Gotta have spares. So that’s $60K. Now, you have to buy all the other stuff that goes along with the cameras. Batteries, replacement storage, mounts, hardware, etc. Call that another $30K. \n\nNow you have to get the service contracts on the cameras, so that when they break, someone will fix them and get them back to you. They’re more than the cost of the cameras, but we’ll pretend they’re the same cost, so that’s another $60K.\n\nSo, we’ve bought a bunch of cameras and the stuff we need to make them work, and spent $150K. \n\nWhat else? \n\nNow we need to talk about software. Specifically, evidence management software. And hardware, because we have to store all that video somewhere, right? So, let’s size some hardware. \n\nAssuming that you have 80 officers work per day, at 50 GB/officer/day, you’re amassing video at a rate of 4 TB per day, or 120 TB per month. Depending on the department’s policies, and the court’s requirements, this evidence has to be stored for a defined amount of time. The shortest policy I’ve ever seen is 3 months, and industry standard seems to be about 2 years. Some departments store for 5.\n\nSo, going with the industry standard of 2 years, you’ve got 2.9 PB of data to store. Now, I don’t work in IT, but my brother does, so I called him. Admittedly, he’s an exec, but he farmed out this question for me. He came back with 21 4U servers, 144TB/server, RAID 6, with an acquisition cost of $1.6MM. For just the hardware. Not to mention the costs of racks, power, etc. Or service.\n\nSo, taking those things into account, you’re now spending $2MM on your storage array. But it has to be redundant, so you have a tape system offsite that will run you another $250K to back it all up. So you’re at $2.25MM for the hardware and software for your hardware. \n\nNow we have to add the costs of the evidence management system. That’s going to run you $50K or so a year. So we’re at $2.3MM for your hardware and software solution.\n\nThis ignores all the other infrastructure to make this system work: networking, wiring, docking cradles, access systems, etc. Call that another $200K.\n\nSo, now we’ve got stuff, we have to add people to run it all. Figure an addition 0.5 FTE to run the arrays, and 3 FTE for the EMS (storing, archiving, recalling, FOIA, prepping evidence, going to court, etc) at $120K a year, you’ve got an ongoing cost of $420K. So, you have to figure that in to your startup costs. So, $2.92MM plus the cost for the cameras, so you’re looking at $3.07MM for first year costs. Ongoing costs are going to be in the $1MM per year range.\n\nSo, let’s compare that against our average department’s budget. This theoretical department is looking at a budget around $20MM per year, so your first year’s costs are 15% of the budget, with ongoing costs around 5%. Given that 95% of a department’s budget goes to personnel costs, this means that there’s literally no way to fund this program without additional taxes.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(3)\tSo, we’ve got cameras and money. Let’s talk policies. There seems to be a belief that because officers carry guns, they are somehow exempt of the protections that are afforded to every other citizen in the United States. I don’t know how to dispel this notion, but let’s just leave alone for the moment that any proposal that requires officers to be videotaped in the bathroom, on the phone, at lunch, etc, will be dead on arrival. There’s no way any union would agree to it, and even if it were forced through by fiat, it’d be overturned by the courts.\n\nMoving beyond that absurdity, we now need to address all the things that officers see and do that would be recorded. They go into people’s homes, cars, businesses, hospital rooms, etc. They interview juveniles, rape victims, assault victims, bystanders, and people not associated with crimes. They see people at their very worst, and everything that they record will have to be available (unless FOIA laws are changed) to the public. This is as true for Joe Citizen as it is for any high-profile citizen or celebrity. \n\nDo we, as a society, want to make this available to anyone with an FOIA request? To youtube? To liveleak? I personally don’t, but that’s my opinion.\n\nMoreover, this gets us into a discussion of the level of surveillance unlike anything we've ever seen. I guarantee that these databases will have facial recognition run on them, which creates a record of every person an officer sees, related to an encounter or not. The FBI has an active system that is in its infancy that will allow this to happen on a country-wide scale. Apparently I’m the only person that finds this a little too far. Even the ACLU has issues with this kind of database. \n\nAll in all, I am a touch tired of hearing from people about how “easy” a solution this is. You need to look up the term panacea. Memorize the definition. Body cameras are a panacea. \n",

    "chosen": "Ghibli films convey a feeling of sublime **wonder** unlike any other art or medium I have ever experienced. A large part of this is exploring the connection between humans and the environment/the world around them through the plot, themes and motifs, and *gorgeous* art.\n\nIn *Spirited Away* this is largely by incorporating spectacularly creative and colorful elements of Japanese Shinto mythology and fantastic scenes and characters. The landscapes and settings portrayed include a touch of steampunk, \"the bizarre\" reminiscent of Lewis Carroll and Alice in Wonderland, and scenes of intense tranquility. As the film follows Chihiro, we get to see some of the most brilliant scenes of both traveling and growing up. \n\n*Princess Mononoke* also presents the Shinto religious motifs and mixes them with the conflict of modernization and human industry/technology/feudalism - portraying environmental themes with a fantasy flair. The incredible strength of character displayed by Ashitaka, Eboshi, and San help carry this film, there is wonder and marvel at their badassness. Ashitaka is a beast.\n\n*Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* was an early pioneer of the apocalyptic wasteland setting. I hate bugs, but the way that the film portrayed the bugs in the movie was so endearing, startlingly innocent, and compassionate it is the only thing that has ever made me feel strongly emotional about bugs. It paints a bleak and haunting beautiful picture about war and devastation and survival in a wasteland all at the same time.\n\n*Kiki's Delivery Service* is another slice of life with picturesque scenes and a touch of magic/witchcraft. The sense of wonder comes via scenes of flight whether by broom, dirigible, bird, or a ill-conceived propeller bike - flying over the charming scenes of urban life while following Kiki's journey of growing up in a new city.\n\nIn *My Neighbor Totoro*, the wonder is strongly tied to slice of life and compelling family themes. The young children encountering Totoro and the catbus as part of moving to their new home and how the fantastic adventure is interweaved with the real struggles of growing up, being raised by one parent while the other deals with illness, and sisterhood.\n\nStudio Ghibli films are breathtakingly gorgeous, crafted for appreciation by children and adults, incorporate serious and meaningful themes, expertly portray the bildungsroman/coming-of-age story/character growth for both male and female protagonists alike, and conduct a sense of wonder in a way that no other piece of art or literature is able to do.",
    "rejected": "I'm unaware of many people who rate movies based on specific criteria outside of movie critics themselves. And even then, most are willing to accept that a movie can be a gestalt, a sum greater than its parts. And even then, critics also accept the visual and spectacle of a movie as being part of whether it's good. Your analysis (or expectation of how someone else would analyze a movie) is almost all technical, which does not speak to the quality of a movie and how it can actually affect people.\n\nSo, here are a few things usually part of why Ghibili movies are considered great which also apply to western movies.\n\n1. Visuals. Especially in an era of nearly-realistic CGI, the sheer awe of a visually stunning movie are part of what make it good. When people put Jurassic Park on their lists of best movies, it is in part because of how gorgeous the visuals were. And how that creates the important sense of wonder that drives the rest of the film. See also Gravity. Or the Lord of the Rings, which was lauded in large part for looking the way that movie should look.\n\n2. Characterization. None of the characters are evil for the sake of evil, or lack convictions which are (at the very least) understandable. The Noh isn't malicious, just misunderstood. Now think about how often bad action movies are slammed for lacking good characterization beyond \"gritty tough hero\" and \"bad guy for no apparent reason.\" That scarecrow from Howl's moving castle has more characterization without *speaking* than Tony Stark has gotten in five movies.\n\n3. Cohesive, character-driven, plots. Benefits of having good characters is that the plots are not macguffin-driven or rely on happenstance or sins of convenience for resolution. \n\n4. Acting. Yep, even animated characters can act. First, they're damned expressive as characters. Second, the voice acting is top-notch.\n\n5. Stories, both relatable to the audience and unique. Yes, it takes a bit of suspension of disbelief to believe in the world of Spirited Away, but not much more than the suspension of disbelief for the Avengers. And once that's taken care of, the story itself is relatable. A young child who irresponsibly acts, and needs to fix it? That's old-school Spielberg at his best. A man who has acted selfishly is confronted with the need to consider others (and love) and risks himself to protect others? Yes, some of them are silly, but the ones people consider among the best movies are ones which resonate.\n\n6. Emotional impact. This comes from the characters being fleshed out and relatable, but there are none but the most hard-hearted who don't tear up at the goddamned scarecrow in Howl's moving castle. That's a more significant emotional impact *without* having to resort to ham-handed tear-jerking."

So although thought of as socially unacceptable it is a stereotype and the idea of a boy seen in the same light playing the game is not outside the comprehension of most people. A girl playing it however is something to remark upon, something to treat her as different for. It drives girls away from the sport at early ages.\n\nJust look at popular culture of chess clubs in tv shows and cartoons if you don't believe me.\n\nTherefore men dominate the sport, further perpetuating the stereotype and keeping women from thinking they can join. By having a women's only tournament it can encourage more women to join and change the stereotype."

Perhaps they have read Howard Zinns \"Peoples History\" and buy his spiel that the War was about managing the freedom of African Americans to stop them from rising up against Capitalism. From this they now have adopted a view that would be best described as contrarian and believe that there is some kind of conspiracy to make the Civil War seem like a more noble enterprise than it truly was.

    "rejected": "I want to comment on a few things, I certainly agree that slavery was a major cause, I don't know if I would consider it the primary cause, maybe, I'm not sure.\n\nSo the whole states rights issue was about the ability for states to decided whether slaves could be owned firstly, and later if states had the right to succeed from the union.  I'm going to go ahead and say here that while slavery is/was involved in every issue, it wasn't always at the center, and in some cases was simply a catalyst for other issues.  So while states rights revolved around slavery, that wouldn't have been necessary for the war to occur, the question of \"how much power to nullify do states have\" came to a head at around the same time that there was a push to end slavery, and both were pushed by each other.\n\nSame with economics, while slavery did/could play a huge issue in that, northerners also owned slaves and plantations in the north, so it wasn't simply slave based economy vs. non slave based, it was relatively self sufficient manufacturing and farming (with relatively few slaves) vs. trade based tobacco and cotton harvesting (with relatively many slaves), based economies.\n\nAnd on that point about racism, as I said, northerners owned slaves, and there were no plans to free those slaves, in fact the emancipation proclamation said nothing about freeing those slaves.  Your comparison breaks down, it would be like the US going to war to fight Hitler's Germany while at the same time establishing concentration camps of its own ^^^except ^^^oh ^^^wait ^^^we ^^^did ^^^that ^^^with ^^^Japanese-Americans ^^^in ^^^WWII.\n\nAnd that I think is the strongest argument as to why it wasn't mainly about slavery, the end to slavery wasn't going to be in the US, it was going to be in the Recessionary states; and, even if it does seem to you that it was still the major issue, this should throw enough doubt on the issue to show that there is easily room for debate on what the \"true motives\" were.  \n\nWas slavery bad?  Hell yes.  Was it a major issue regarding the Civil war?  Hell yes.  Was it the major issue?  Maybe, possibly.  Is anyone who disagrees with that sentiment an apologist?  No.\n\nI think another way to put it, much more succinctly is this:  The south was fighting for their right to continue to use slaves.  The north was fighting to keep the south around, no matter their plans."

Going out to bars, drinking at parties, on holidays, with meals, these are all common and socially accepted behaviors. While cannabis enjoys growing support in the US, it is still seen as taboo by many. I can call up pretty much anyone I know and say \"want to grab a drink?\" But I can only call a handful of people and say \"want to smoke?\"\n\nI would also challenge the idea that using alcohol is somehow less dangerous than using cannabis.\n\nFirstly, in 2010 the rate of alcohol induced deaths, *excluding* homicide and accidents, was [25,692](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm). The number of deaths attributed to marijuana overdose is [zero](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Causes_of_Death#sthash.eFOl670x.dpbs) every year.\n\nThis is because alcohol becomes toxic if you ingest about six-times the intoxicating dose. Marijuana, on the other hand, has the toxic dose estimated at about 10,000 times the intoxicating dose. (*Illegal Drugs*, Paul Gahlinger).\n\nSo from a practical social standpoint, cannabis does less harm than alcohol. But what about it's addictiveness?\n\nIn fact, while there is evidence that cannabis can cause a psychological dependence, ~~it does not cause a physical one. This is because the [nucleus accumbens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens#Addiction_and_drug_use), the brain's \"reward center,\" does not have THC receptors, so using cannabis does not create the same physical dependence behavior as the use of [cocaine, heroine, nicotine, and alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens#Addiction_and_drug_use), all of which excite the reward center.~~ [1]\n\nWhat about when it's time to kick the habit?\n\nLet's look at the physical effects of detoxing from alcohol dependence. I'm just going to bullet point this one from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism#Alcohol_withdrawal):\n\n* As with barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal can be fatal if it is not properly managed. \n\n* Increased stimulation of the GABAA receptor results in tolerance and physical dependence. \n\n* When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure.\n\nHere are the worst withdrawl symptoms I could find for [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_dependence#Diagnostic_criteria):\n\n\"insomnia, cravings, restlessness, loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, sweating, mood swings, raise in temperature, depression, irritability, and anger.\"\n\nNow, while those are definitely negative, they are no where near the drawbacks to kicking alcohol. The bottom line is that, on every front, alcohol addiction is more dangerous and more damaging in the long term.\n\nEdit[1] thanks to /u/Hatious for point out that there [**are** THC receptors in the nucleus accumbens](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/teaching-packets/brain-actions-cocaine-opiates-marijuana/section-iii-introduction-to-drugs-abuse-cocaine-opia-11).",
    "rejected": " &gt;Legalization would just support the idea that it doesn't do any harm and getting high everyday is ok\n\nWhat people seem to forget, is that we have a perfect example of what happens when drugs are legalized right in front of us, and that is alcohol. When alcohol was legalized, did everyone drink alcohol everyday and think that alcohol was completely safe? No. The same will happen for cannabis in fact more information will be available about the drug, because it will be easier to gain permits to use in studies.\n\nAnother thing you need to understand to have your view changed, is addiction. There is mental addiction as well as physical addiction. The rate at which cannabis users get addicted to cannabis physically, is around 10 percent. For alcohol, it's around 15 percent. That means that you know 5% more alcohol addicts than you do weed addicts. Chances are you know possibly a few alcoholics, and the people litterally addicted to weed are much less than even that number.\n\nAlso ask yourself, is there anything wrong with using a drug everyday? Why? If you answer, because its bad, how do you know? Multiple studies have shown that marijuana is actually a Neuro-protectant and may possibly help with Neuron growth. Multiple people use SSRI's perscribed by doctors every day, which can cause tonnes of harm to the brain.\n\nLife is about enjoyment, fun, happiness. We only have a certain amount  of time on this planet, is if fair that we have to work? Why do we have to work? to pay off debt that the government makes in a way. (this is a whole other topic) But basically, if they are happy and enjoying life, who cares?\n\nAnother thing to consider is the harm that alcohol does to others. Never will a person beat their wife or children because of being high, but that can be very prevalent in alcoholics. Alcoholism causes fights and violence, cannabis does not. Alcoholics get brain damage as well as liver damage, their is no evidence for brain damage from cannabis for people over 18. So don't only look at the physical effects on the person, look at the effects of those around them as well."

    "chosen": "My father has extensively studied marriage and divorce law and there is a lot to be said about this subject. He could do better than me, but he's not a redditor.\n\nMarriage operates legally as a joining of two people for almost all purposes. Obviously, they can be tried for crimes separately and such, but rights such as ownership of property and the right to make medical decisions for the other person when necessary are strong binding forces.\n\nThis gets extremely confusing. If you read [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_and_responsibilities_of_marriages_in_the_United_States) you'll notice that a great many of the responsibilities within are designed to make other laws make sense, to give spouses as much legal weight as each other when making most meaningful decisions (in an economic or health-related sense). For instance, joint adoption rights involves a ton of specific details.\n\nTo address your question, based on the legally joined nature of two people, it makes sense from a legal perspective to help those people be economically stable. It is easier to get unemployment benefits if you're married, because the government *anticipates* that you may have kids and recognizes that the family unit ought to be more stable for that purpose. You pay less taxes because the government is trying to compensate for the cost of children, which is ever-increasing. As soon as you factor in that there are going to be dependents who *can't pay for themselves*, what the government is really doing is subsidizing the cost (or anticipated cost, in the cases of couples without kids) of those who can't pay for themselves yet. This is done in an effort to improve family quality of life, especially for children. It is not a discriminatory practice and it is, in many cases, economically necessary for people.\n\nPerhaps the argument could be made that assuming married couples will have kids is immoral because it allows two people to contribute less to society than those who are single (due to less taxes, etc). But I would argue that the law makes sense based on the fact that the vast majority of married couples do indeed have children.\n\nSo yes, the government invests somewhat unequally in those who have or are likely to have kids. To me, this is a morally upright practice, because it allows people to have to worry less about the cost of children. Imagine wanting a child desperately, for biological and lifestyle reasons, but being economically unable to justify it to yourself.\n\nNote also the timing of disbursed benefits. The government does not give *massive* tax breaks or exemptions to married couples without kids. They are smaller. The biggest benefits come with children. I would argue, as my father would, that the economic marriage benefits are meant to allow married couples to more easily prime themselves for the initial costs of children, most notably hospital bills from births. Whether most people use the benefits for that purpose is another matter entirely.\n\nI hope I have adequately addressed this matter. I tried to bring up diversified arguments but I understand there are naturally going to be gaps, or perhaps I didn't adequately answer part of your question. I hope I did.",
    "rejected": "&gt; I can't come up with a reason other than that it is their way of investing in you to reproduce to create the next generation of workers.\n\nHumans tend to form romantic couples and these are and should be viewed as economic units. Consider a stay-at-home mom whose husband makes a lot of money. If the government does not recognize this as an economic unit, then it views the woman as basically indigent and gives her unnecessary financial support. Recognizing the household as a household makes her life _more_ difficult, since she's not getting unemployment benefits.\n\nThere are also necessary legal protections. We recognize that couples tend to work differently than other groups of humans. For example, if someone steals my car I am likely to press charges. I will never see this person again and can safely return to my home. Suppose it is my husband, with whom I share a home. What are my choices now? In fact, just to survive, many spouses let their spouses commit crimes against them and police now have laws to prosecute spouses when the abused spouse refuses (presumably because of fear of easy reprisal). This is why we have to be able to recognize domestic units, so that we can talk about the special legal difficulties of these close, romantic relationships.\n\nWe have to be able to recognize these units because we need to know what to do with them when they split up. Two people living in the same apartment have not expressed an intention to support each other financially, so when they split we don't think we ought to redistribute their wealth. In long-lasting romantic relationships in which resources have been shared for quite some time?\n\nThis is important in terms of sickness and death, when the government needs to know who is making the decisions for someone in a coma. There needs to a default and, if romantic partners are not recognized as the default, chaos will ensue. This is one of the major reasons LGBT people want recognition - marriage allows us to act in the place of our spouse in a lot of legal, financial questions.\n\nThere are lots of reasons we'd want to recognize these relationships legally and I'd argue that doing so doesn't make everything easier."

Where I'd argue against you is that the baddies aren't necessarily male humans - I feel just as bad about the stupid Kobolds. :P\n\nThese masses of baddies as an obstacle to be killed suck whether they're male, female, human, or not (*The Hobbit* had that dreadful scene with the goblins... how many died that day?

    "prompt": "Homosexuality is a sin according to the Christian viewpoint.",
    "chosen": "I think it's important to read the Bible for what it is: a varying set of books written in different styles, by different people, in different contexts and with different motivations.  I'm not saying that we doubt the validity of what is said, just that we bear a larger burden of interpretation than most denominations are comfortable with.\n\nI personally don't believe that homosexuality is wrong.  My case for this is fairly simple.  It begins with Matthew 7:1-3:\n\n&gt;1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.\n\n&gt;2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\n\n&gt;3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n\nThis passage is one of several that suggests a specific command from Jesus that makes a great deal of intuitive sense.  We are all flawed, we all do immoral things, so our judgment of what is moral is inherently imperfect.  To use that judgment in anything but a spare manner is to risk hypocrisy.  If we find ourselves condemning something for no reason other than a one-liner in the Bible that *appears* to prohibit it, we are doing exactly what Jesus tore into the Pharisees for doing.\n\nIn short, the backdrop for all of this is that we need to assume as little as possible if we're going to have a moral leg to stand on.  If we are to contend that homosexuality is wrong (and condemn homosexuals by default); we need bang-up, rock-solid evidence.  I don't think we have it.\n\nFirst, Jesus himself never addressed the issue.  Some contend that there is implicit backing of the idea when Jesus addresses divorce (\"made male and female\"), but that's a stretch.  An unsupported inference made within our cultural context (He would have had no reason to address gay marriage/divorce) and outside of His (He was referencing Genesis) is not enough to make a declaration.  In my personal view, it isn't enough to raise a suggestion.  Beyond that, I find it difficult to view homosexuality as a very important moral issue when it is flat-out never spoken of.\n\nThe remaining passages that *may* deal with homosexuality were written by apostles well after Jesus' death.  To follow me past this point, you'll have to concede that the Bible is not the verbatim word of God.  It was written by flawed humans living in and writing to address specific contexts.  They may have incorporated local conventions as valid moral ideas or condemned something that was part of the \"other\" to make a rhetorical point.  Couple that with Jesus' tendency during His life to shock his apostles with the things He would both do and permit, I think we need to view apostolic letters with a good deal of scrutiny when we look for binding commands that are applicable now.\n\nThere are three verses in the New Testament that are usually applied (Romans 1:27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, 1 Timothy 1:9-10) and their application is contingent upon the translation of two words (*arsenokoitēs* and *malakos*).  Every one of those is disputed.  What they all have in common is a tangential reference to homosexual behavior\n\nThe dispute over the definitions of the two words follows the same basic model: we assumed for a long time that each word must have meant homosexuality (of some form) as we presently understand it when that may not actually be the case.  There is contextual evidence that leads some to believe that each word actually meant something other than that and would have been understood in a different way by audiences of the time.\n\n*Malakos* appears in Corinthians and has been interpreted a number of different ways, but many contemporaneous uses of the word suggest that the word referred to specific practices; namely pederasty and prostitution of young males.  If that isn't the correct interpretation, then the term only refers to a passive (effeminate) male partner.  So that would suggest that somehow giving it is okay, but taking it is a no-no.\n\n*Arsenokoitēs* is a weird one.  It may have been a Colbert-esque invention on Paul's part (truthiness), which is itself kind of odd because there were existing terms in Greek that explicitly referred to homosexual sex.  Contemporaneous references containing the same word have carried connotations that the word means sodomy or pederasty.  The alternative (and more conventional) idea is that the word is a transliteration from the Hebrew terms used in Leviticus (\"lays with man as with woman\") and there's some merit to that idea.  But keep in mind that the prevailing form of homosexual activity in the Greco-Roman world was what we would call pederasty or ephebophilia.\n\nSo when considering the verse from Romans (a letter to be recieved by Romans), remember that a contemporary Roman would probably understand homosexuality as a pederastic relationship.  In fact, the idea of a \"sexual orientation\" was (as far as we know) not something the Romans used.  They didn't really have a gay or a straight to speak of.\n\nSo given the disputed nature of those two words and the surrounding passages, we have some personal interpretation to do.  Is God speaking against homosexuality or pederasty?\n\nWe condemn pederastic relationships now because we know that those relationships are inherently exploitative and damaging.  They are unfair and arguably exist without rational consent of all parties.\n\nWe observe homosexuality as a generally harmless practice (no more harmful than heterosexuality) and one that appears to arise out of love and desire for human companionship.\n\n**TL;DR/Conclusion** - Based on the evidence at hand, I find it difficult to believe that God is condemning what appears to be a permutation of love. I find it more likely that the authors in question were writing within the context of their time speaking to and condemning a commonly accepted but harmful practice.  ",
    "rejected": "If you've studied scripture much, you know that much of scripture is open to interpretation. \n\nI believe that when making any interpretation, it is important to first step back and ask if this interpretation passes a test of basic morality. If the interpretation results in an abominable or evil outcome, then there must be something wrong with it. \n\nFor instance, consider an extreme example. If someone comes to me and tells me that a certain passage of the Bible tells me that it's perfectly moral to rape or murder children, well I know that this interpretation is wrong. I'm not going to even consider what passages he might be quoting. I know that no just God would ever condone such a horrible thing, so, from the beginning, I know his interpretation must be flawed.\n\nCondemnations of homosexuality are no different. I base this on the following logic:\n\nFirst, we at this point know that people are born gay, straight, bi, etc. We've seen same-sex attractions throughout nature, and they have existed throughout human history. All of modern psychology and neural science consider sexual orientation to be innate and immutable. Thus, if there is a God and He creates people, for whatever reason, He has chosen to make people this way.\n\nSecond, we know that people being gay causes no objective harm in and of itself. The only harm that happens is from people abusing gay people. For example, children raised in same-sex households have no higher rates of juvenile delinquency, high school dropouts, crime, mental disorders, etc. \n\nBy any criteria you can actually measure, children raised in same-sex households turn out as good or better than children raised in mixed-sex households. This objective harm principle is key, as many things which are natural also cause objective harm and are thus fine to condemn. Some people suffer extreme mental illness that causes them to murder others. They are mentally ill through no choice of their own, but this illness causes real harm in the world, and this thus something to be combated as best as medical science can.\n\nSo, we know sexual orientation is innate and does not cause harm. If God indeed exists and indeed creates people, then God chooses to create some people gay. \n\nNow, finally we have to look at God. To believe that God condemns homosexuality, you have to believe that:\n\n1. God creates people a certain way, a certain way that harms no one.\n\n2. God has arbitrarily chosen this one characteristic and decided to condemn people for it. \n\nIn other words, God is condemning people for acting the very way he chose to make them. It would be like if God considered being left-handed to be a sin. Sure, a God could do this, but these are not the actions of a just, loving, and all-compassionate God.\n\nIf you believe God makes people gay and then condemns them forever for acting this way, then your god is a sociopath. Only a cruel, malevolent, heartless monster of a god could ever do something so abominable and cruel. Such a god would be evil beyond all imagining and would thus be completely unworthy or worship. If you worship such a god, you are not worshiping a just God, you are worshiping a Devil. \n\nI for one simply cannot worship an evil God. As such, I know any interpretation that condemns homosexuality simply must be incorrect. People have looked at all these passages and come up with plenty of alternative interpretations that do not result in blanket condemnations of people based on their sexual orientation. As I do not wish to worship Satan, I am inclined to believe these interpretations."

Wolff's chapter in [this book](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199204250.do#.UdUYvxZU5Hw), which I agree with entirely.) But I don't agree about the correctness of utilitarianism. Besides the objections others have made, there are two points I want to bring up. The first is the phenomenon of *adaptive preferences*: if we take utility to be the satisfaction of preferences, then utility can be increased merely as people lower their expectations. Since human beings have been proven by social scientists to adjust their expectations to their circumstances (see Jon Elster, *Sour Grapes*), oppression—say, of slaves, or of women—does not reduce utility as much as one would think. But an eighteenth-century Christian housewife's being content with her situation wouldn't justify her deprivation of important opportunities for self-development and for autonomy. Preferences are not the only thing that matters from the perspective of justice, or of moral goodness.\n\nThe second point is the impossibility of *interpersonal comparisons* of utility. Regardless of how you conceive of utility, there will be no way to sum people's utility together to produce anything like a total utility function. If you conceive of utility as being a sort of mental state—pleasure or desire-fulfillment—then you run immediately into the problem of measurement and quantification: in the words of 19th-century utilitarian economist W. S. Jevons, \"Every mind is inscrutable to every other mind and no common denominator of feelings is possible.\" In light of this, people started conceiving of utility as preference satisfaction: I might not be able to give an absolute value to a mental state *a* or *b* and know how that compares to someone's else's mental states *c* or *d*, but I can tell if I prefer doing *x* or doing *y*. But there's a problem. Amartya Sen puts it well:\n\n&gt;This approach has the advantage of not requiring that we undertake the difficult exercise of comparing different persons' mental conditions (such as pleasures or desires), but correspondingly, it closes the door *altogether* to the possibility of direct interpersonal comparisons of utilities (utility is each individual's separately scaled representation of her preferences). Since a person does not really have the option of becoming someone else, interpersonal comparisons of choice-based utility cannot be \"read off\" from the actual choices. (*Development as Freedom*, 86)\n\nSo it's impossible to know whether we're maximizing utility because utilities cannot be plugged into any kind of meaningful function for a population larger than one. At best, utilitarianism is an impracticable idea; at worst, not even philosophically coherent.\n\nsome small edits within 15 minutes for clarity",

For example:\n\n&gt; Not only do I believe that this is the *correct* moral philosophy, I believe that any system of morality which rejects the core utilitarian belief that maximum total happiness (utility) is the only valid end is inherently evil and misguided, and should be eliminated. The argument that people have the right to certain views or such don't make sense to me, because a utilitarian world is better than a non-utilitarian one.\n\n\"A utilitarian world is better than a non-utilitarian one\" is only true if you define \"better\" to mean \"greater collective happiness\"--which is an assumption of utilitarianism, but not a universal axiom.  Maybe I define \"better\" such that world A is better than world B if I, individually, am happier in world A than world B.  There's nothing incorrect about this definition, because definitions, by their very nature, have no concept of \"correct\" or \"incorrect\".\n\nWhich is ultimately your problem--you assume definitions of \"better\" and \"moral\" that directly imply that utilitarianism is \"better\" and \"moral\"; but someone with different definitions of those words is going to disagree with you, and you can't really argue with that.\n\nFinally, your final points don't resonate with me:  A utility monster seems like a pretty obvious negative to me; I don't see how you can argue that that would be a positive, unless you're already assuming that utilitarianism is the best system of morals."

You know yourself, your situation and if these things might help.*\n  \nTo be honest.  So long as you are a good/fun person to be around, you can make A LOT of friends by being the sober one.\n\nI never went to college, but in the barracks (dorm rooms) on base I had people I never knew seek me out to have me drive their expensive sports car/SUV for them.  Being the DD has its advantages.    \n\nBeing the only sober one is only a bad thing is you want it to be.  Sure people will tease you about it, but you will be teased about something regardless, that just happens to be an easy target.\n\nSo don't feel as if you have to drink to have friends.  You have to be friendly/social to have friends.\n\nThat said,  if you really want to not exclude yourself most people can have a single beer and not get uncontrollably drunk.  Even lightweights.\n\nSo if it's that much a worry, my suggestion is this.  Next party or social setting you go to, have a single beer and stop there.  Keep that red solo cup (or bottle) half full and just walk around carrying it  (an empty cup is an invitation for someone to get you another).  If you have been able to fend off friends trying to get you to drink already, you can probably have a single drink and stop there for the night.  People will tease you for nursing it, or whatnot.  again, most of this is good natured ribbing.  Nothing to worry about.  Just explain you might have to DD tonight or something is they insist (and they probably will).\n\nDo that a few times.  You're friends and peers will not care that you don't get blackout drunk with them. Especially when you will likely be the only reason they got home when they did.  After a couple times of this kind of thing, people will just know you as the guy who doesn't get wasted.  OWN THAT SHIT.  That's you, don't be embarrassed to be described that way.  Be proud of it and be confused as to why someone would not want to be like you because you are awesome.\n\nIt sounds like you might be a bit insecure about yourself and your choices (most people are at that age and some just know how to hide it better).  I would suggest a subreddit like /r/seddit .  It has a bad reputation but in reality seduction is all about being the best you possible.

This kind of community is something I wish I found years ago at your age becasue I was painfully shy for far too long (and still am truthfully)\n\nAs for drugs and smoking.  No reason to ever start.  Anytime someone bothers you about it, just say it's not your thing.  Don't talk down to them about it, don't say is gross or dangerous or expensive or any of that stuff.  That will just start an argument and will do nothing but get you excluded.  If anyone pushes much more than that ask them why it's such a big deal to them.  *You* direct the flow of conversation at *them* and their insistence. Let them be defensive instead.

    "prompt": "I think literature (and Bible, but that's just my country) should not be taught in high-school. It's a useless subject for a large majority and a completely uninteresting subject for most kids.",
    "chosen": "When it comes to the Bible, I absolutely agree.\n\nHowever, literature is a lot more than just silly stories written in a complicated way.  When I was in high school, I probably would have agreed with you.  English was the only compulsory subject in the last two years of school, and I was annoyed that I had to take it.  It ended up being my worst class by a long way.  Even today, I (and the few literature students/graduates I know) think that it's taught poorly in high schools.  English teachers absolutely have a habit of trying to find meaning where there isn't any.  If I can get technical for a minute, it's downright unparsimonious, and the sooner someone can figure out the literary equivalent of the Akaike Information Criterion, the better.\n\nThat being said, plenty of literature has meaning, and value in that meaning.  To plug some of my favourite books, *Catch-22* captures the sheer absurdity of war in a way that no documentary ever can.  A philosophy text can go into depth about the relationship between rationality and external power, but you'll never grok it as well as you would if you'd read *Nineteen Eighty-Four*.  No toxicology textbook will ever explain heroin addiction to you as well as *Trainspotting*.  These books aren't about nothing.  In a way, they're more real than history.  Good literature is about the underlying themes of human history, with all the noise stripped out.\n\nAnd that's why it needs to be taught in high school.  Mathematics teaches you how to strip reality down to its fundamentals, and do away with all the mess.  Great literature does the same thing for the story of humanity, and boils it down the the essentials.  Learning how to do that, how to process the world, is the most important thing you can learn at school.",
    "rejected": "History is far more than just literal events. History is about different points of view, different cultures and paradigm shifts in populations and the people who trive or oppose them.

Keep in mind that stories are written by _people_. People who hold their own opinions, had their own life experiences and their cultural biases. For an easy example; take 1984, about a hyper-surveillance state. This was written somewhere in the 50s and is still somewhat relevant today. Relevant enough that terms like 'Big Brother' for a surveillance apparatus are commonly used. Eventually literary works can be so embedded in a culture that they become a big part of it and when that happens understanding the story will help understanding the culture.\n\nI agree about poems though. I hate them and they all sound like nonsense to me."

    "prompt": "Racial labels should not be encouraged (e.g. African-American, minority) as it actually encourages division instead of equality; to promote equality and a just society we should be referring to all members of all races by their nationality",
    "chosen": "I'm always a bit puzzled by this kind of position. What kind of 'solution' do you propose for this? How is it workable? Perhaps you're just asserting this as your view for part of a moral code - that 'right' action and behavior includes not referring to people as their race, but only their nationality.\n\nAs with most moral arguments that don't involve a legalistic element, this one seems absurd to me. First of all, you can't ever 'accomplish' this; it's a goal that can't be reached (this isn't damning in and of itself). But, more importantly I don't think we could ever come close and that this is more akin to fantasy than reality. Secondly, it ignores that *however small, there is some degree to which race, as a concept, is scientific*. Radiolab did an excellent episode on this; while 'race' isn't a thing per se, someone's ancestry and the traits passed on therefrom can actually be read in our DNA. And, you know... *you can actually see with your eye that people have different physical traits*. This goes beyond mere skin color; people from different regions have developed in numerous different ways when it comes to physical attributes.\n\nSo when you say:\n\n&gt; Because then if all races are indistinguishable from each other and are known by their nationality, then no subtle separation of identity happens and we can say we have realised equality on a small, social scale as well as the large, fundamental scale that we've achieved in recent decades.\n\nAll races will never be 'indistinguishable' from each other.\n\nFurthermore, this argument, while riding the coattails of the current, feel-good, leftist understanding of humanity is actually rather disparaging to the differences between ethnic groups. You're talking mere tolerance here, and an attempt to reach a 'color-blindness' that most even on the left would consider a pipe dream. What about nationalities with multiple ethnic groups with distinct cultures and identities? Look at, say, Iran. You have Persians, Arabs, Jews, Turks, Turkmen, Yazidis and many, many other groups. While such differences in ethnicity may not be important to us in the west with our cosmopolitan lifestyle, in other countries, your ethnic group informs a lot more about who you are. Simply calling a Turk and a Yazidi from Iran an 'Iranian' would be reducing their identities to a level that even the two people in question would object to.\n\nObviously people shouldn't be treated poorly because of their race or ethnicity - but to me, my ancestry and heritage are things that are essentially parts of my identity. I think most people feel the same way about their ethnic make-up. Not acknowledging this because it highlights that there are differences between mankind might avoid any possibility of discrimination (can't discriminate against people who are different if no one is different!) but it is a weak-willed way to look at the world. It attempts to remove the impediment to accepting everyone equally for who they are by denying that there should be any challenge to accepting others who are different, because no 'different' people exist.\n\nWell, not only is that not true, people at large will never be made to believe it, so it is worthless as a moral theory. You can't impose this with legal force (regulating the thoughts and beliefs of others isn't possible), so it is worthless as a legal proposition. If it is merely your personal view on how you'd like to treat others - okay, that's certainly one way to do it.\n\nBut rather than *ignoring* the fact that we are different because we've developed different attributes because of a different heritage isn't really the way I'd prefer to go. I'd rather reckon someone who *who they are* - isn't it nobler to accept them for that? Isn't it nobler to treat them equally, even though you are different? Isn't it more worthy an undertaking to transcend and go above racial concerns, rather than try to ignore that racial differences even exist?\n\nAnd frankly, you can easily identify someone by the color of their hair. Your skin is the largest organ of the body, covering most of your exterior, which makes it even easier to identify someone by this trait. Why is it bad to say \"that black guy\" but not \"that blonde guy\", say, if you're pointing someone out in a crowd? I'd give people enough credit to be able to identify someone by a physical trait without developing racial hatred because of that.",
    "rejected": "Advocating a color-blind society is an easy thing to do when one belongs to an empowered race; by ignoring race, you ignore your own race, thus naturalizing any privileges that come with being your race. Ignoring races makes it easy to ignore very real issues such as institutionalized racism. To fight racism, you have to talk about race.\n\nI'm going to go a bit off your point here, but I've often heard people say things like, \"I wish we wouldn't talk about racism so much, it only divides people.\" This is a bit different than what you argue, but it's related and I'd like to address it anyway. Most would agree that it's important to talk about our history to avoid making the mistakes we've made in the past. Racism is a part of our history, so we have to talk about race. 50 years ago, you could have looked in a US history textbook and there might only be one paragraph about the history of slavery and segregation. Today, the treatment of minorities groups is a central theme in many textbooks. *As American society has become more racially aware, racism has faded from our culture.* Racism is now stigmatized, and overt prejudice and discrimination is nearly dead.\n\nNow to address your point more directly, American culture is far from monolithic or homogeneous. America is a \"melting pot\" composed of several sub-cultures. Simply identifying with your nationality means identifying with only one aspect of your identity. People may label themselves so that they can identify with their sub-culture or their heritage. To ask people to only identify themselves as American is to ask them to forget their personal culture and history. "

Having a drink of wine, or a beer after work, is fine. \n\n[Medical Link](http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20040614/moderate-drinking-wont-hurt-most-people)\n\n[Another Medical Link](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/alcohol-full-story/#possible_health_benefits)\n\nMedically, moderate consumption of alcohol is fine. When a person starts abusing alcohol, like many things in life, will alcohol become a serious medical issue. \n\nYou're argument is more about the social effects of alcohol. It gives you, \"liquid courage\", impairs judgement, leads to violent incidents, and becomes a social crutch that many people rely on to be, you know, social. These are true, but what you have to keep in mind is these come with *abusing* alcohol. Not consuming it. Alcohol abuse is going out and getting shittered. Alcohol abuse is not going out and having a casual beer after work. \n\n\nSaying that, the younger you are the more negative effects alcohol abuse will have on your mind. \n\n[Link \"Drinking Alcohol Damages Teenage Minds\"](http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/HealthIssues/1127400726.html)\n\nIn the above article,**\"There appears to be absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the light or moderate consumption of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 causes any brain impairment or harm.\"**\n\nSo, I mean, the article header is a little misleading, but it does misspell some myths regarding alcohol consumption amongst youth. Laws dictate against youth alcohol consumption, but there is nothing wrong with youth having a glass of wine at dinner. Casual drinking (one or two drinks) amongst youth have occurred in societies throughout history, and continue in come parts of the world to this day. \n\nLight to moderate alcohol consumption has little to no health effects, even amongst youth. If light-moderate alcohol consumption has little health effect, it is tough to determine the mental effects of light-moderate alcohol consumption. A glass of wine or a pint of beer after work reduces immediate stress, such as having a tough day at work, and helps a person relax. \n\nIts when alcohol consumption becomes alcohol abuse (getting drunk) do serious immediate health effects occur, such as loss of memory, coordination, inhibition, and judgement.

    "rejected": "Actions should be judged in terms of the happiness they provide to the person taking them, with consideration for the harm they might or do in fact cause to others.\n\nI, for example, do not get any personal enjoyment out of doing sudoku puzzles. But I cannot assert that sudoku puzzles are a reprehensible activity simply because they provide me no pleasure. They provide others great pleasure, and for that reason I must recognize that sudoku puzzles have value insofar as they make the people who enjoy them happy.\n\nThe case is the same for the consumption of alcohol in a social and responsible context. Now, the fact that alcohol has effects on the body and the mind that can lead one to take actions that can harm others is a very fair point, and one that I wouldn't dispute. If your argument were only that drinking is a bad activity when pursued to the extent that one's judgment becomes irresponsibly impaired and harm to others becomes a strong possibility, I think you'd have a very strong case.\n\nThe choice of others to drink because it makes them happy, however, even if they are capable of doing it responsibly and their choice to drink does not harm anyone else, is much more difficult to justify. Can you assert that drinking socially does not make others happy, or provide them with enjoyable experiences? Can you prove that whatever altered mental state is conferred upon them has the negative effect upon their lives that it has upon you? \n\nIt seems to me that you are on shaky ground when many of your points center on a substitution of your personal opinions about the effects of drinking in lieu of the actual feelings of people who enjoy it. If drinking changes someone's perception in a way that they enjoy, but that you find distasteful, does that entitle you to claim that your distaste is more valid than their genuine pleasure?"

So here we go.\n\nOf course there's always going to be one or two opinions out there that are ethically correct and thus there is no moral argument against them. I doubt there is a proof of nonexistence of an ethically correct opinion. \n\nSo the result is that the statement of this cmv is utterly useless. So the meaningful question isn't the one of existence. I think you actually state it as fact so I will say no more about existence.\n\nThe actual meaningful questions are which opinions are ethically correct, and how do I change an opinion? What if I think that exercising free will, failing to procreate, or just being gay is unethical? Well it's the job of the subreddit to change that. How?\n\nOpinions don't come from nowhere (most of them at least). Usually you start from a core value and follows a bunch of if then statements. Eg don't do to others what you wouldn't want done to you which leads nicely into something like the ten commandments (past the third at least) into most widely agreed upon opinions.\n\nAnd if someone holds a core value close (gay people are the scum of the earth) you aren't going to be able to change that, especially not over the Internet. (note that other not as scummy opinions such as murder is wrong and nickelback sucks should be included in the set of closely held core values). You will never be able to convince that person that gay people are awesome. The point of all this is to say you won't get a good constructive proof of what they are wrong. \n\nSo there are only really two ways to attack someone's view: the best tool you have is going to be proof by contradiction, which is pretty semantic once you think about it. But most arguments of this type are going to be responded to with either calling it slippery slope or reduction ad absurdum (whatever the exact name was). These labels aren't always wrong and so these types of arguments aren't always easy to make. \n\nThe easy way is to argue semantics. Why argue the main point when you can take a badly phrased part of the argument, which may or may not be insignificant to the view, and argue that instead? \n\nYou know like I've been doing so far? Only the first 4 sentences have been about existence of ethically correct arguments and the use of semantics to argue them. A little has gone into what constitutes a proper argument. The rest has been making up some question you didn't ask, hoping to change a view you may or may not have had. But did it get you to start thinking more closely about your view? Possibly instill some doubt?\n\nBecause a view is wrong only if part of the view is wrong. (I don't believe the converse to be true). To convince someone their view is wrong you must first convince them part of their view is wrong. Semantics is an easy way to do that. Once you see what gives you have a better idea of how to proceed. ",

One of the reasons that more and more people are support Gay rights is because the semantic discussion around what rights straight people posses that are systematically denied to Gay people, opinions start to change. When you start pointing out what rights gays are denied, people's views change. When you explain that gay people can be fired for being gay; that they can be denied inheritance from their life partners by estranged family; the right to have a say in the health care of their life partner and on for 6,000 some various bits of law and regulation tied to the definition of marriage; people who oppose gay marriage will generally still come down on the side of \"yes -- that stuff sucks, and we should do something about that.\" \n\nAt that point, the conversation can become focused on the reality that we can either spend billions of dollars to systematically change thousands of laws and regulations across every city, county, metro area and state. Or we can pass a single law giving marriage rights to gays and fix the majority of issues. And it becomes clear that the opposition is not one about rights at all, but about a particular theocratic understanding of marriage, that puts them in opposition to gay rights. \n\nBut that's a great thing, because then those who are arguing for gay rights can actually have a conversation with the person arguing against them on the actual substance and content of their opposition. Semantics is critical to actually discovering the issue of debate. \n\nTo dismiss an argument as to being just about semantics is to say that one can meaningfully argue against an imprecise and ambiguous statement. \n"

    "chosen": "What you're describing is called the Model Minority Myth. [From this thread titled: 'ELI5: Why have Asian-Americans flourished, while African-Americans remain under-educated &amp; impoverished? Both were slaves here at one point, and both were heavily discriminated against throughout US history.'](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2e0886/eli5_why_have_asianamericans_flourished_while/cjutza6)  \n\n&gt;Alright I'll give this a shot. I'm an Asian American, family coming here over 30 years ago as poor refugees after a civil war. I've interned and worked at various Asian American organizations in America and studied Asian American Studies in college.  \n\n&gt;First, you are right in that you're making a broad generalization. Not all APIAs are in the situation you speak of. Same with Black Americans. In fact, the broad generalization of Asians being rich and smart is called the \"Asian American Model Minority Myth\". The stereotype paints a picture of smart, educated, assimilated, and rich Asians in America that have \"made it\" and suggests the Asian race doesn't need a hand out or help. It also suggests the question \"if Asians can do it, why can't Latinos/Blacks/Natives/West Virginians/Purple people do it too?\" This is a problem in that it's suggesting a few things. 1: Asians are inherently smart and that it's tied to race. 2: Overlooks the Asian Americans that struggle, especially groups that are refugees (Vietnamese, Cambodians, Lao, Hmong, Karen, etc.) 3: Suggests that other races aren't up to par as this \"model minority\" group.  \n\n&gt;Secondly, understand that the APIA racial category in America is vastly diverse. This is an important factor. You have very rich, highly education APIAs, and also very poor ones that are on welfare. You have Indians, Chinese, Koreans, Tibetans, Polynesians, Samoans, Thais, etc.  \n\n&gt;Third, because of that diversity, you have different socio-economic levels within the racial category. And the reasons behind this, which you are asking, is vast. Some reasons are:  \n\n&gt;* Socio-economic mobility in America is tied to the family or individual's socio-economic status in the old country. For example, many military officials, government officials, politicians, etc. from the former S. Vietnam fled here from their country to escape persecution. These are families that were exposed to many things that would help any family in upward mobility, namely, some English skills, standardized education (some even had P.hDs from France or the US), and money. Compare that to a super poor, illiterate farm family fleeing the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and you have two vastly different families that will develop differently in the States.  \n\n&gt;* US immigration policy has always been hard for Asians. The Chinese exclusion act of 188X (on my phone, forgot) was the first (and maybe only?) US law excluding a specific race from immigrating to the US. So for the longest time, until about the 1960s, Asian immigration was capped. This is somewhat important in that this is why the APIA population is small (3.4% of the population).  \n\n&gt;* Some Asian Americans have been here for a very, very long time and have been able to acquire more and more in each generation. The Japanese are an example of this. They mainly came over 100 years ago. As generations are born in the states, they assimilate and take on more opportunities. During WWII, Japanese American men comprised of several military units that fought valiantly in Europe. They then came back, went to school, and became successful. Daniel Inouye is a good example of this. There are dozens of Japanese American politicians who are 3-4th generation. They're success lies in the fact that their families have been established in America for generations. Vice versa may apply. If your family is poor, there a chance your kids will be poor, and being poor may continue for generations.  \n\n&gt;* As another posted suggested, rich Asians come here and succeed in numbers that rival Asian Americans. My University had a huge ass Korean and Chinese international student population. They made up 50% or so of the \"Asian\" student population. These guys were filthy fuckin rich.

And this comes from someone who really knows the matter.\n\nI personally don't like police forces, and I know lots of people who hate cops even more than I do. And that's quite a lot.

Those don't really hate cops, they only go around saying \"**That** cop was a real idiot. He gave me a ticket!\"\n\n* Who hate cops because got in trouble for something serious, for example a robbery. If they spent time in prison, those people are even more likely to express this kind of hate: \"Cops are only pigs, they framed me! I did almost nothing!\"\n\n* Who hate cops because of the social group they are in, to fulfill what's usually seen as a stereotype and conform to the social norm. An example in America nowadays are all those wannabe *gansta* young people.\n\n* Who hare police because of political and philosophical causes. For example: anarchists, communists, some socialists...\n\nMost of Reddit is made up of white, quite sheltered and very moderate, yet progressive, guys in their twenties. This category doesn't really match up with my examples, so I think it's kinda far-fetched saying that Reddit *hates* police and cops.\n\nSome people, a minority, hates or at least dislikes police and police officers. But, considering the anonymity policy we have here, those numbers are likely inflated.\n\nReddit dislikes bad cops and likes simple example of justice it can relate to, but sometimes people target cops in general because people **need** to talk shit about who's in charge. Just like teenagers who won't stop talking about how shitty their parents are.\n\n------\n\nOn an unrelated note, ACAB. Carlo lives.",

    "prompt": "That American society is getting better, not worse",
    "chosen": "I would be careful to conflate falling crime and increasing technology with an improvement in American society. Technology tends to always increase over time, and crime can fluctuate in a long-term pattern. Just because it's falling now, doesn't mean it will continue to do so indefinitely.\n\nAs for 'quality of life increasing', this is questionable. The United States has been experiencing [increased income inequality since at least 1967](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Indicators), which hasn't been made any better by the huge number of government cuts that were seen in the 80s and the 90s under Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. Many of these cuts were justified by claiming that \"it is the individuals choice to not work a better job\", which grossly misunderstands the point of income mobility: if you close the path to helping people move up the social ladder, their situation at the bottom will make them fail to do so.\n\nBesides that, there are a number of factors that suggest that the US is slowly slipping into decline:\n\n* The US has [the world's highest incarceration rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate#Prison_population), with 754 out of every 100,000 americans being in jail or prison. A great deal of these people are minor offenders, who are in jail for no more than possessing marijuana, being homeless, or being a minority in the wrong place at the wrong time. The US is also one of only a handful of countries with 'private prison' facilities, but by far has the most. These prisons have in the past been accused of such things as [bribing judges to send children to jail for minor offences](http://www.jlc.org/current-initiatives/promoting-fairness-courts/luzerne-kids-cash-scandal) (or in some cases, no offences), and [lobbying local governments to create new crimes to send people to jail for](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison#Lobbying).\n* The state of public education in the United States is in a downturn. Despite the US being tied in first with Switzerland in annual spending per student, many teachers find themselves spending their own money on supplies for their students, and the disparity in funding between some public schools is astounding. Some states also believe that they should be [teaching evolution and Christian creationism side by side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States#Curriculum), acting as though Creationism is a legitimate scientific view (which it obviously isn't).\n* American culture is becoming stupider and promoting poor behaviour. Hit shows such as Jersey Shore, 16 and Pregnant, and Keeping Up With the Kardashians promote binge drinking, underage unprotected sex, and general mediocrity. Younger audiences, which are particularly susceptible to media, are picking up on the behaviours they see on TV and emulating them. In 1996, American teenagers were getting [more pregnant than any other country with available data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_teenage_pregnancy#Birth_and_abortion_rates.2C_1996), and only recently does evidence suggest that this phenomenon might be going down.\n* Bipartisanship in government is increasing. Republican/Democrat bipartisanship is no new ordeal, but in recent years, especially since the election of Obama and the fallout of the Iraq war, it has increased dramatically, and arguably has divided much of the nation. The peak, of course, was the [2013 federal government shutdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2013), in which the United States went without most federal services for a full 15 days because Congress and the President couldn't agree on a budget. The fact that such a thing can even happen in the first place is bewildering to people in most other countries (especially developed ones), but the fact that it came about because of such a sharp ideological difference between the Republican Lower House and the Democratic Presidency should be startling to Americans, and should definitely serve as a wake up call that the current system of government isn't working in such a polarized society.\n* The USA is experiencing the militarization of police like no developed country has ever seen. Mostly due to overproduction by military manufacturers, or from the sale of older equipment by the military to local police forces to minimize loss, local police forces are purchasing military equipment for everything from anti-terrorism to border security, and of course, curbing protests. In 2013, [as much as $1.6B in grant money was awarded to local departments for spending on military gear](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/20/police-billions-homeland-security-military-equipment), as well as [a total of $5.1B since 1997 through the US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)'s 1033 program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1033_program). This has been criticized as excessive for typical law enforcement, and has been even more criticized in the wake of the Ferguson protests, where it has been used not just to quell protestors, but arguably to aggravate more protests, occupy the town of Ferguson, and quell dissent altogether. Militarization of police also shows a great distrust of the local government to its people, and makes the assumption that the citizen is the enemy.\n\nCertainly, other countries do face similar issues that are on this list. However, when combined, they cause a malady of problems in the United States that arguably are moving American society in the wrong direction. A country with such enormous production capability and human potential can do much better than where it's at now. However, people seem adamant in doing anything about it, especially when the answer involves higher taxes or more spending.\n\nSome countries, such as the Netherlands and Japan, seem to avoid this by coincidence: both are dense countries, and the need for cooperation and organization is high. In the Netherlands, no one questions zoning laws put forth by the government, because everyone understands the dike system keeps the country above sea level. In Japan, employees, no matter where they work, understand their position in society and are not often eager to demand more than what they have. CEOs have also been known to self-regulate their incomes to ensure that employees are also earning a standard wage.\n\nI would argue that much of the problem in the US is a lack of organization and cooperation between people. American's aren't as easily able to grasp communalism or socialism, or see them as beneficial, because both infringe on their individual liberties, on which the country is based. People need to get out of the mindset of putting themselves first, and think for a moment about how they fit in to their society.\n\nAs John F. Kennedy said in his inaugural address, \"And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\"",

Part-time work is way up, deferred retirements are up, predatory lending is way up. Social mobility is way down. The average worker today is paid less than half of what they were paid in 1970 for equivalent productivity.\n\nAmerican education is highly unequal, with the bad effects being centralized in poor regions and communities, leaving educational deserts in much of America (there is a class of American schools known as the \"dropout factories.\") American tuition is up over 1000% over the last 20 years. Student debt is at all-time global highs in America and climbing.\n\nIncarceration rates remain near their all-time peaks and are highly stratified by race.

    "chosen": "The idea of corporate tax cuts isn't necessarily intended to help the business directly. The ecconomic liberation that it brings to the upper class is supposed to \"trickle down\" to everyone else.The idea of trickle-down economics was used to much success during [Reagan's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics) administration. The basic idea is not that cutting taxes will create jobs. The idea is that the wealthy will be able to invest more; It's not necessarily about the business itself. It's kind of an abstract concept and I'm not explaining it too well. If we make the top class more successful, they won't have to be as frugal, per-say. They can take their profits and invest them rather than hoard their heavily-taxed income. The aid is not intended to go directly into the company, but rather trickle down.\n\nTo me, the idea of cutting taxes on big business is not really about helping that business directly, but rather increase economic freedom to allow the surplus to trickle down. It worked well for Reagan's years even with his enormous Cold War spending, although I'm ill-equipped to argue that it'd work for us now.",
    "rejected": "Just to preface, I am not an economist, I just read some of the literature out there by economics. Politically I am moderate, I just want whatever policy that works to be implemented.\n\nFor your main point that there is no evidence, there is actually alot of evidence that reducing the corporate tax rate actually is revenue neutral for the government while increasing investment (though not doing anything for employment) (Mertens, Ravn. The Dynamic Effects of Personal and Corporate Income Tax Changes in the US. American Economic Review 2013). Furthermore, simulations have shown that outright elimination of the corporate tax will increase investments, wages, and output (Fehr, Kotlikoff et al. Simulating the Elimination of the U.S. Corporate Income Tax. NCPA 2007). That being said, that simulation was dependent on other countries not responding in kind, which is a huge assumption. There is also evidence that the corporate tax hurts labor more than the company (Arulampalam, Devereux et al. The Direct Incidence of Coporate Income Tax on Wages. European Economic Review 2012). That paper concludes that about 50% of corporate tax is actually passed onto the workforce in the form of lower wages.\n\nSo you could argue that the corporate tax should drive investment rather than hold it back (as most people do). The way the corporate tax works is that it only taxes profit. As such, it is in the company's interest to invest into either more workforce or equipment or research before the end of the year. The problem with this assumption is that you're basically forcing the company to take a risk. Either lose money on this fiscal year on taxes, or bet the money on the next fiscal year and hope your investments pay off in the form of increased revenue. If your investments don't pay off, well... you're shit out of luck. \n\nAlso, a good company does not just sit on profit. A stagnant company often goes into decline. Look at Yahoo. For a long time, they did not do anything to grow their brand. Look where they are at now, they lost their huge lead to Google. Instead, a good company will create demand, either through advertising (Coke vs Pepsi) or find a new source of demand (Google investing into Android). In this way, the successful companies continue to grow. Remember, investment doesn't necessarily have to come from just hiring workers. Any form of investment including advertising, R&amp;D, buying new equipment helps the consumer economy because jobs are being created, just not in their own company. As such, reducing the corporate tax allows a company to be more flexible in their investments, rather than forcing them into smaller, yearly investments. "

    "chosen": "The keyword in your CMV that I’m going to latch onto is the word “deserve”.\n\nSome of the punishments received by people in various countries are cruel to say the least. Often the degree of gruesomeness is hard or impossible to fathom for anyone who hasn’t experienced it. Others in the thread have already mentioned that people in Singapore (and Malaysia) receive caning (a form of torture) for some crimes. North Korea is the epitome of cruel and unusual punishment, placing people in concentration camps for the rest of their lives *and the next three generations after them*, where they have insufficient access to food, no access to information, no entertainment, virtually no interaction with other prisoners, and virtually no free time from hard, slavelike physical labor.\n\nThe view that you have expressed is that anyone who goes to a country and breaks one of its laws, even unknowingly or accidentally, *deserves* this form of punishment, and the only reason you’ve stated for that is that one could have known beforehand what one was in for.\n\nIf you honestly believe that, then you shouldn’t mind if your home country also started administering such punishments, or you would be inconsistent. After all, here in the “western world”, we clearly lay out the fate that awaits anyone who breaks the law, so you always know what you’re in for when you commit a crime, right?\n\nBut you know that European and North American countries do not, in general, make use of such inhumane sentences. Why is that? It’s because their population (largely) believes that, as human beings, we *do not deserve* certain kinds of treatment, *even after committing a crime*. The kinds of gruesome punishments I’m thinking of are considered to be *in violation of human rights*, and criminals are humans too. Logically, you don’t stop being a human when you go to another country, so it would be a double-standard to say that a certain punishment would be *deserved* over there but not over here.\n\nNow, (most of) the population of (most) western countries believes this *even about criminals who have committed heinous acts against their fellow humans*. Your CMV, however, is not even about heinous crimes, but about political activism and religious proselytization, both acts in which other humans *aren’t even being hurt*. Any reasonable human being in their right mind would not consider a jail sentence to be a commensurate punishment for such an action, much less for it to be *deserved*. The reason those governments jail you for it is because of political circumstances (e.g. corruption) and not because they really believe you morally *deserve* it.",

Officer X just saw tourist Y put a recyclable bottle in a non-recyclable trash can. This breaks some obscure law that no sane tourist would know of, but Officer X is a douchebag on a powertrip and now has the authority to make tourist Y's life a living hell.\n\nOr the fact that these places are rife with corruption and they can just throw you in jail and find some bullshit charge to stick to you after the fact. Whether it was some obscure law, or a straight up lie that's corroborated by their buddy. It could be as little as a wrong look towards the wrong person, or as much as trying to extort someone for money and said person not cooperating.\n\nThen there's the issue of humane punishment. Having your hand chopped off for stealing a candy bar, for instance, is a bit overkill. Sure, you shouldn't be stealing candy bars, but permanently losing a limb in a gruesome manner is a bit much of a price to pay for a regrettable mistake. Punishments like these also generally involve people that don't know the consequences of what they're doing carry such harsh penalties in the places they are. What sane person would steal a candy bar if they *knew* they'd lose their hand if caught?\n\nThere's a lot of opportunity for abuse if your government doesn't stand up for you.

    "chosen": "I don't know about you, but six-year-old me rampaged through Pokemon Red with what ended up being a level 94 Blastoise.\n\nIf you're actually using any strategy, gym leaders in Pokemon are trivial. They ALL (with one interesting, but not particularly difficult exception) specialize in one type. That one type will have several weaknesses, and at least one of those will likely be shared by every Pokemon in the gym by necessity. Also, at least one of the Pokemon available before that gym (and likely a few) will have a good move that is strong against that gym. THIS IS GOOD GAME DESIGN. The alternative is to have nothing strong against the gym, and have to grind up mediocre mons instead of using strategy in the battle.\n\nBrock was, in the case of Charmander-Choosers, BAD GAME DESIGN. There was nothing Charmander could do against Brock until a reasonably high level, and most of the other Pokemon you could catch before Brock were equally useless. Note that in Yellow version, they added Mankeys and gave Nidoran Double Kick, and in FireRed, they let Charmander learn Metal Claw (super-effective against Rock types) at level 13. Not being able to use good strategies is not a good kind of difficulty.\n\nMisty was not quite as bad because you were given the ability to catch grass types before her. Hell, I'd argue that she was the best gym leader because she was difficult for all three starters to some degree. Water attacks hit Charmander, Confusion hurt Bulbasaur, and Squirtle wasn't very effective against her, while she could hit Squirtle neutrally with Confusion. \n\nGood difficulty in a pokemon game shouldn't be caused by needing grinding, but it also shouldn't be caused by being denied the tools to fight gym leaders. \n\nFinally, the difficulty in Pokemon battles doesn't come from type combos or move match-ups. When you're playing real players, everyone has a rough idea not to leave a Parasect in against a Charizard. The interesting difficulty here comes from the mind games and battle plans you have to set up against the opposing player, which Pokemon AI cannot yet execute effectively. \n\nThe real point of gym leaders in pokemon games is to try to expose players to different types of Pokemon, not provide a significant challenge. An electric gym will showcase the best electric types in the region, and a rock gym will show off the coolest rock types. Note that it is very common for players to be able to catch the same pokemon gym members use in either the area directly before, or the area directly after the gym. Since every Pokemon is usable to beat the game, it lets players discover and use only their favorites.\n\nThe other real reason for gyms is to try (emphasis on try, because a sufficiently leveled starter can tank the whole game) to force players to diversify their teams. Bringing a fire starter to the water gym? You're gonna have a bad time, unless you catch some of the electric and grass types conveniently outside of town.\n\nTL;DR - No matter what, Pokemon against an AI is going to be easy (and at best, difficult in a way that can be solved by grinding). The goal of gyms isn't really to provide a challenge, but to promote players to try different pokemon.",
    "rejected": "Ironically, I find Gen 1 to be one of the easiest because of terrible AI, I mean look at Twitchplayspokemon and Venomoth taking down Dragonite. Gen 3 would have had the same difficulty for the first gym if it wasn't for Combusken's double kick, and I find Brawly to be more difficult than Misty. I think that Black and White 2 had a good difficulty level, mostly as a reaction to Black and White which were some of the easiest. But I think a lot of that stems from your experience. Remember, these are new games when they come out, designed for casual players. Yes they have some people who come back a lot, but quite a significant portion won't know EVERYTHING about the game, even former players playing a new generation. Thus, I think that for quite a lot of players, even given a type advantage, if they even have a pokemon of that type, will not necessarily always sweep an entire gym. Gym leaders tend to have better AI, especially in later generations, than traditional trainers, as well as better pokemon, and even with type advantages they can still put up a good fight. With a lot of games if you know everything about them they're easy, but I think a lot of players find gym leaders to be a reasonable challenge, kids or not. I even know some people who could never finished BW2 because of the difficulty increase."

    "prompt": "Killing baby cows for food is no more immoral than killing adult cows for food.",
    "chosen": "I actually had this [exact debate yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/39khuv/my_least_favorite_thing_about_australia_is_their/cs4srum) over on /r/vegan, I'm curious if you were motivated by that to post this? I'll take on your argument here though. I've been meaning to look into this more in depth anyway.\n\nSo I disagree with you that (1) does not matter. The only way for me to say that it is worse to kill a baby cow than an adult cow is to say that there are degrees of badness in killing animals, and that requires me to be able to say that it can be bad to kill an animal, otherwise I could only say that it is not bad to kill animals, and there could be no degree of immorality in that scenario. And I think you must admit that there are degrees of such, as my neighbor's pet dog is clearly much happier than a calf in a veal crate, and you have said that happiness and suffering does matter in animals. The question is then, does the calf suffer more than your average beef cow?\n\nNow while I think you under-estimate the cow's ability to feel pain, I don't think I need to press this point so much as the difference between a veal calf's reality and a standard beef cow's. Beef cows do spend time outside. Here's an [EPA article](http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/beefphases.html) on the subject. However, the outside they spend time in often does not have grass, and is only a feedlot. During winter they can be confined inside, and also confined a few months before slaughter to help fatten them up. They are most often dehorned as well, without anesthetic. However, veal calves not only experience all this, (94% of dairy calves are dehorned, while about 17% of those calves are given anesthetic. [Page 109](http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/dairy/downloads/dairy07/Dairy07_ir_CalfHealth.pdf). There's no debate that dehorning causes pain.) but must do so *while being starved and confined in a crate for the entirety of their life.* So I think we can say that veal calves suffer at least twice as much as your average beef cow.\n\nDuration of suffering matters too though. So how long is that miserable calf's existence? The MSPCA says veal calves suffer [for about 18 weeks](http://www.mspca.org/programs/animal-protection-legislation/animal-welfare/farm-animal-welfare/factory-farming/cows/veal-calves-on-a-factory-farm.html), or 4.5 months before slaughter, and since the age of veal calves is such a contentious issue, pretty much all sources have the same number. I couldn't find any official data on beef cows, (or steers), but scouring around forums gives me about 18 months for commercially raised, non-grass fed beef. ([1](http://www.homesteadingtoday.com/livestock-forums/cattle/235359-age-slaughter-steer.html),[2](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/beef-farming/page-7),[3](http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/feeding-cattle.html)).\n\nSo the numbers add up quite nicely, 18/4.5 = 4, meaning steers suffer for 4 times as long as veal calves before slaughter. So the suffering of 1 veal calf is 1 unit, and a steer is 4 units. However, (and there is official USDA data on this, thank god), we get about [880 lbs](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/BD7FAEF0-CFC8-3E27-A0EB-67C04E8FB488) of edible meat per beef cow, and only about [175 lbs](http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/4D51FF2B-04BC-3312-8D46-ED424F7C2D01) per veal calf. 880/175 = ~5, meaning per lb of meat you eat, you cause a 5x longer duration of suffering for veal calves. do the math and we have 5 units of suffering per lb of veal eaten, and 4 units per lb of beef. This is purely on a basis of duration, not intensity, of suffering... even though as I've argued above, we have good reason to believe that veal calves suffer more. So you would have to actually argue not only that veal calves don't suffer more, but that they actually *suffer less*, in order to justify the view that eating veal is no worse than eating beef.\n\nOn top of that, every purchase of veal covers a negative expense of the dairy industry. If we stopped paying for veal, not only would the dairy industry lose its profits, but it would actually suffer, as it would still be producing calves, simply not selling them. Whereas if we were to stop buying burgers, the beef industry would stop raising cattle, and would lose profits, but not actually go into debt.\n\nAnd finally, there's a great practical reason to consider veal worse than beef, once again, *even if the suffering is the same.* Imagine I give you the opportunity to live in two societies. One in which it is considered just as bad to kill an adult as it is a baby, and one in which it is considered worse to kill a baby than an adult. I think it's clear that a society that considers cruelty to adults not as bad as cruelty to children would be a better society, for indirect reasons such as the need to protect children more, and the moral innocence of children, and by saying that there's nothing worse in killing a baby for food than there is in killing an adult, you're supporting a worse society, however rational your view may seem at surface.\n\nAll things considered, I think there's very good reason to find killing baby cows for food more immoral than killing adult cows, even though both are clearly immoral.",
    "rejected": "Since the lives of cattle are unpleasant, on the surface it seems that slaughtering them at an earlier age would minimize suffering and would therefore be less immoral.\n\nThe reality of veal however, is that it is essentially a by-product of the dairy industry.  To keep cows lactating they must constantly be producing calves.  Excess male calves are often used for veal rather than raised as steers, or (very rarely) breeding bulls simply because it takes less time and space away from their more profitable mothers.  A dairy cow generally lives about 5 years until it's milk production wanes, while steers raised for meat are only forced to live 18 months or so, and obviously veal calves get to die very quickly.\n\nSo while killing baby cows may alleviate more suffering than killing adult cows for food, in practice it is inextricably linked to keeping adult cows alive for food, causing them to suffer far more than they would had they been raised for meat rather than milk.  Add to the fact that many of these calves wouldn't have to be born or suffer at all if not for their essential role in keeping dairy cows lactating."

    "chosen": "\" how do you KNOW that you are fighting for the right?\"\nIn Iraq fighting against groups that are responsible for ethnic cleansing and encouraging political reconciliation between dissident groups so they can disagree peacefully earns the moral high ground. \n\nIn Afghanistan the Taliban are not in the business of winning \"hearts and minds\", or giving the Afghans better quality of life, they are in the business of reconquering the country, and in the process have been absolutely brutal. I recall story when in Nuristan province a U.S. commander was having a shura with local tribal elders who were fence sitting. He simply asked them \"Who do you think has a better vision for Afghanistan, the Taliban or us?\" The answer is obvious. You can disagree with the political motivations for going to war in the first place, but in terms of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan you will have an impossible time trying to prove that the intentions and efforts of the occupying forces doesn't hold the moral high ground as opposed to the opposition they face.\n\n\"I've seen alot of soldiers state that they are there for peaceful purposes, and if that is the case, why don't we have a peacekeeping organization that can be signed up for opposed to the military. In my opinion, 2 organizations seperated like this would have completely different view on how to handle situations. If we do have an organization like this, why not join that?\"\n\nModern counter insurgency conflicts are not just military operations any more, its a massive spectrum of tasks and goals that go into rehabilitating a failed state in addition to whatever challenges the insurgency faces. In Iraq and Afghanistan, because of the nature and goal of the wars, there were dozens of organizations both American and non-governmental international organizations working on the ground. But the fundamental problem is that it is a warzone, the security situation is the first concern to be addressed, and humanitarian work cannot commence if there is no semblance of security. In Afghanistan and Iraq humanitarian workers for non military organizations have been killed and kidnapped by insurgents, construction contractors as well. A famous incident was Al Qaeda bombing  the headquarters of the U.N. Assistance mission in Iraq in 2003, which killed the U.N. high commissioner for human rights Sergio de Mello. The role of the soldier in these recent wars hasn't been solely to drop firepower, it has been to provide population security, facilitate good governance, political mediation, and improving the local economy through reconstruction funds, to name a few of the hats that soldiers have been made to wear. \n\n\"I just don't see how going in to kill people can be respected, especially when they are sometimes innocent, a classic example is the \"collateral damage\" video, where it is very clear they are not there for peaceful purposes.\"\n\nThe collateral murder video has been twisted by wikileaks and popular opinion into an atrocity when in fact it is adhering to proper rules of engagement, but the most important thing to realize is context. I frequent /r/combatfootage, one of the most important things to understand of viewing videos of this sort is that the people being filmed have a far higher degree of situational awareness than the viewer does. And in war, because there is no such thing as perfect opportunities or perfect situational awareness, the most logical decision can be to drop firepower, and you can still be at fault for killing innocent noncombatants. But the mistake you made is that you cannot characterize an entire war effort based on one video of combat footage, it takes an depth understanding of the history of the conflict to make a wholesome judgement.\n\n\"Is there any points to the wars we are in right now, other than money for the contractors and equipment providers? War is a major driver of this terrible economic system, and without it, millions of people wouldn't have jobs. It seems that it is kept around solely for the purpose of keeping the economy running.\"\n\nThe Iraq war ended in 2011, Afghanistan is set to end at the end of 2014 but there will likely be an American residual presence. When it comes to discussing what to do during war, what needs to happen is an intelligent discussion of interests and resources, not a knee jerk reaction in the spirit of American isolationism. Many people in the military and intelligence community included, in hindsight, view the Iraq war as a strategic mistake. But once inside the country, regardless of the motivations to invade, the American military was responsible for the well being of the Iraqi people. The occupation remained longer than expected because Iraq had descended into chaos, Al Qaeda sparked a religious civil war that took the form of ethnic cleansing campaigns by bombing one of the most holy mosques in Shia Islam in Feb 2006. This civil war is what accounts for the hundreds of thousands of civilian dead. The mission of the Iraq war was redefined to much more modest terms, to basically leave the country in a semi normal state of security as well as to foster political reconciliation between dissident groups and insurgents so the Iraqis could figure out there difference via politics rather than communal war, as well as destroyed Al Qaeda in Iraq. All these objectives were met by the surge that was implemented in 2007 which facilitated the sunni tribal \"awakening\" which began in late 2006. \nIn terms of Afghanistan it was the war that was started after 9/11 to attack Al Qaeda, after the initial campaign Al Qaeda and the Taliban were hurt badly but fled to Pakistan's western frontier province, where they still reside today. Pakistan with strong encouragement from the U.S. has tried to invade this area but because they are an incompetent military and horrible counter insurgents, each major operation was a failure that ended in ceasefires that strongly favored the insurgents. The Pakistani military and government has essentially no influence in this region anymore. Personally, I think that there should be a residual force in Afghanistan because of the fact that that area in Pakistan is the safe haven of many terrorist and insurgent organizations, not just Al Qaeda or the Taliban. And I don't think the Afghan military or government is capable enough to hold off the Taliban. \nIn terms of economy the money that gets pumped into a war effort is more than just weapons. Especially in counter insurgency wars, the type of wars that Afghanistan and Iraq became after the brief initial conventional operations, there isn't as much utility for expensive munitions and assets like tanks or strategic bombers or warships, since there is no conventional military style force to destroy. http://www.militaryindustrialcomplex.com/ This site reports all DoD contracts. If you browse, very few have anything to do with weapons development or procurement. As to why the wars were so expensive, I haven't yet investigated it thoroughly, but the logistical needs of maintaining occupations simply beyond ammunition and ordinance is substantial. When fighting counter insurgency wars, there is a phrase that \"money is ammunition\", so for these conflicts commanders on the ground have had discretionary budgets to fund development projects. I believe the Defense Department accounts for around 20-25% of the annual federal budget for the past ten years, but only 3-5% of the national GDP. \n\nIn terms of mindset of the troops I would agree there is some blind idealism in it. But in terms of fighting for freedom and democracy, the course of my own personal study into the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has led me to believe this is very much true with respect that they were fighting for a better Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nI'd also like to add [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ih4u9/fuck_the_troops_cmv/cb4vwjr), which won the delta on a thread here in this subreddit titled \"Fuck the troops\"\n\n\n",
    "rejected": "I think you are looking for an idealistic response to this, but sadly the political world isn't about looking pretty and being idealistic.  There's a commonly held belief in global politics stemming from Karl Von Clausewitz that \"War is the continuation of Politik by other means\", and by extension, that war (and violence of varying scale) occurs where it is the most viable option for entities to advance their goals.  \n\nThus, peace only occurs in scenarios where War is not a viable option.  \n\nThe only real way to make war not a viable option (and thus guarantee peace) is to maintain a omnipresent threat of imminent doom should violence be put on the table. Right now, yes, there have been episodes of violence worldwide since the second world war, but the sum total of armed conflict from the end of Second World War to now represents a small fraction of what either world war was.  In essence, despite the existence of armed conflict still in the world, we are in a period of relative peace that has been enforced first by US and Soviet power, and since the fall of the soviet union, by US hegemony.  \n\nPut more simply, people have, for the most part, made the decision to actively not be killing each other on extreme scales because there have been international superpowers capable of wiping them off the planet with relatively minimal effort.  To use the NOD phrase, it's Peace Through Power.  \n\nI'm not sure what you think 'peacekeeping' is, but it's not some magical power gained from blue UN helmets.  It's not the humanitarian aid, it's not the good works they do for the communities they visit.  It's not that anything about 'peacekeepers' themselves that engenders any degree of local respect.  Peacekeepers work out of the threat of overwhelming violence potential - people tend not to fuck with peacekeepers, because the response is quick, violent, and incredibly asymmetrical.  It looks nice on the surface, but really, the gun is very much pointed at the heads of the belligerents.  \n\nWhen it comes to the economic point, I think that this is something of a narrow-minded (but popular) view.  Yes, there are a lot of individuals with a lot of money that have a lot to gain by keeping military contracts flowing, but that's something entirely different from actually driving the economy.  Militarism for its own sake is inherently a cost center unless the actions of the military force directly yield economic gain (which hasn't happened for hundreds of years now).  Even in the USA, military spending is only 4.4% of GDP which, while a massive amount, doesn't consist of a driving force for our economy as a whole by any stretch of the imagination.  The numbers simply don't support that the US keeps up militarism for economic purposes. \n\nSo, in summary, being a soldier isn't a pretty job, but it's certainly a necessary one.  Peace exists because there's someone walking around with a very very big, unpleasant stick that wants peace to continue. Occasional extreme and asymmetrical violence is the unpleasant cost of the peaceful world we take for granted.  Freedom isn't free, and it's no less free simply because we've already beaten down the biggest threats out there to it. "

    "chosen": "The law already makes allowances for an affirmative defense in criminal proceedings. In an affirmative defense, the accused admits to committing the criminal act but provides a justification or excuse for their actions--duress, necessity, insanity, self-defense, etc. In such cases, a successful affirmative defense reduces or even entirely removes culpability for a criminal act. One famous example of an affirmative defense was \"the burning bed\" case, where a battered woman essentially lost her mind and burned up her abusive husband while he slept. She was found not guilty of murder by reason of temporary insanity. So, while she faced consequences for her actions, the jury decided that she was not of sound mind at the time and therefore not responsible.\n\nProsecutors generally have a fair amount of discretion when deciding whether to bring charges against an individual for criminal actions. They must weigh the cost of a trial against the probable outcome based on the strength of their case. I can't imagine that too many prosecutors would be willing to spend the time and money to prosecute a person for assaulting someone who *in the process* of raping their child. It is highly likely that a jury would be willing to excuse such behavior, especially in the heat of the moment, and the trial would be a waste of taxpayer money.\n\n&gt; I could excuse some degree of injury to the perpetrator, but their are countless cases of parents severely or even kill the perpetrator, and I feel like this should face penalty under the law.\n\nCountless cases of vigilante assault and/or murder that are never charged?

    "prompt": "I believe that the modern-day large unions cause more problems than they solve. CMV",
    "chosen": "I'm going to take a stab at this, I was in a teamster for a few years and definitely have some gripes with unions but also see their utility. Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nYour first point isn't really an issue with unions specifically but with any large organization. According to wikipedia the AFL-CIO has over 11.5 million members, and the teamsters have over 1.3 million. Whenever you are dealing with organizations at that scale bureaucracy is somewhat inevitable. \n\nI'll address points 2 &amp; 3 together as they are related. *In my view* and by most accounts I think labor unions have made huuuge strides in their 'fundamental' work as you put it. Let me give you an example. I mentioned that I was a teamster for a few years, I worked through graduate school **part time** (20-25 hrs/wk) 3rd shift. While my pay wasn't spectacular (~12.50/hr) it was unskilled, manual labor. On top of that I received tuition benefits (up to $3,000/yr), health insurance, dental &amp; vision, childcare benefits (I dont have kids), a week of paid vacation a year, and a few sick days. I want to reiterate again that this was part time, unskilled manual labor. During the same time I was employed part time by a large research hospital for research related to my field of study. My job at this hospital, doing graduate-level medical research gave me a whopping ($10/hr) and absolutely no benefits. The point of this is that union membership often comes with a lot of perks. That being said, the big trend right now (in the US) to limit/break/bust unions is not coming from the individual level of businesses but is coming from the policy level with initiatives like right-to-work. Strategists have figured out that the single best way to harm unions is to decrease/limit their membership. This causes a decrease in union dues, and a decrease in union power/influence which becomes a kind of downward spiral. The only way for the unions to fight back these initiatives is also at the policy level via lobbying. A union that doesn't do this is leaving itself vulnerable from the top.\n\nAnd finally, your last point about insensitivity to business needs. While there is a decent amount of negativity (some rightly so) to union job perks, and how difficult it is to get fired from a union job, it has some serious advantages for for the business as well. From my limited understanding, a union contract is kind of like the business sub-contracting out its labor. So the company I worked for had very little to do with the workforce in terms of disciplinary action and the union was responsible for making sure everything got done. So if you skipped out on work one day, it was oftentimes union reps who you would have to answer to not company management. For the company I worked for, this had advantages in sense that there were maybe 10 non-union managers and ~50-75 union employees who in essence self-regulate themselves via union reps who were also workers. Now specifically to your point about 'large' unions, the thing about my former employer using this union was that if the shop was short-staffed for some reason, oftentimes other union workers from nearby locations (same employer, different location) would come in to fill in. That is certainly an advantage for the business.\n\nI realize that a lot of this is anecdotal and may not speak to other unions, but my view on the issue is that union labor works for some businesses and not for others. So while unions might 'cause more problems than they solve' in some fields, they are highly beneficial to others. The only way for unions to keep themselves alive and well is through political lobbying and growth as that increases their influence, membership, and dues. Unions aren't perfect, but at the end of the day they are one of the few large organizations that advocate for laborers on all levels from policy &amp; gov't down to individual perks and benefits. ",
    "rejected": "&gt;Large unions tend, from what I've seen, to have a leadership clique that has its own views that aren't necessarily the views of the majority of workers\n\nDo you also believe that government causes more problems than it solves? Union leadership is voted in, reflecting the will of the members.\n\n&gt;An excellent example is when a union representing some, but not all, workers at a given employer manages to get a deal requiring all employees to be unionized. While this might sound good on the face of it, if the employer (say, a construction worker) also wishes to hire employees in a job that isn't normally unionized (say, HR), this puts a tremendous drag on the employer and ultimately isn't likely to benefit the represented employees.\n\nThis is not normally the case - generally unions will require union labor for the work that they do. Work outside of that is either ignored or in cases of unions banding together, specifying what work would be covered under union labor.\n\nHR represents a management function, I've never heard of a union taking HR reps. \n\n&gt;by arguing for things that affect \"the working-class\", such as arguing for lower taxes\n\nWhen they know the income of their employees, which are substantially all the same, why would it be outside their scope to lobby for lower taxes on their employees? \n\n&gt;Lastly, and probably most importantly, the big unions seem to often be extremely insensitive to the employers' needs, ultimately to the detriment of the workers they represent.\n\nWith Hostess, I would argue that the union knew where it's stopping point was. When risking lowering wages for all it's employees across multiple employers, at some point you have to say that the pay cut one employer is saying is required is too much, or risk diluting the pay of your employees over multiple employers. \n\nI would also point out that the union in the Hostess case, what they were asking would not have made hostess unprofitable. At no point was Hostess losing money, and if they signed the contact as the union suggested, Hostess would not be losing money. \n\nThe owners wanted to sell the company, and the unions were bringing down their price. They closed up shop to shed union labor, then sold their business. Those jobs would have been sold off anyway - the owners had been trying to sell prior. Those jobs would have been lost anyway. Why dilute your value with other employers when some asshat is trying to negotiate below industry wages in order to make themselves more look more profitable to a buyer, who most likely will move the jobs anyway?\n\nNot withstanding your above points, even if you disagree with all of my responses, unemployment in the US is driving down labor costs. The only way for workers in a lot of 'low barrier entry' jobs to negotiate is to negotiate collectively. This is huge. Like 'can my family eat' huge. Unions still fill that need. "

The celebrities of the mid-20th century sold a lot more albums than any of the the current biggest hits, yet we have a lot more indies making a living than ever. \n\n That's because when the Beatles were big, if you wanted to listen to them, you HAD TO buy an album, with few alternatives.

In terms of morals, if you don't pay your taxes, you then need to avoid using anything that is paid for by taxes or the public. If the government would then tax you anyways, then yes I suppose that would be theft.\n\nHowever, such a circumstance is an impossibility in the modern world- you were of course not asked to be born, or if you wanted to grow up within a social structure, but what is the alternative?",
    "rejected": "&gt; For example, the ten commandments includes \"Don't steal\", and the rest of the bible has no exception for taxes (\"give to Caesar\" is for the taxee, not the taxer.

As for \"give to Caesar\", that may be your interpretation, but there are many others, including one that says that those who use the government's services (in this case the coinage, if you read the original story).\n\nThere's also this: http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13\n\n&gt; Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. ... This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. 7 Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\n\n----\n\nThis may interest you:\n\nhttp://raikoth.net/libertarian.html#moral_systems\n\n&gt; 12.2: Taxation is theft. And when the government forces you to work under their rules, for the amount of money they say you can earn, that's slavery. Surely you're not in favor of theft and slavery.\n\n&gt; Our language contains a lot of words like these which package a description with a moral judgment. For example, “murderer” (think of pacifists screaming it at soldiers, who do fit the technical definition “someone who kills someone else”), “greedy” (all corporations are “greedy” if you mean they would very much like to have more money, but politicians talking about “greedy corporations” manage to transform it into something else entirely) and of course that old stand-by “infidel”, which sounds like sufficient reason to hate a member of another religion, when in fact it simply means a member of another religion. It's a stupid, cheap trick unworthy of anyone interested in serious rational discussion.\n\n&gt; And calling taxation “theft” is exactly the same sort of trick. What's theft? It's taking something without permission. So it's true that taxation is theft, but if you just mean it involves taking without permission, then everyone from Lew Rockwell up to the head of the IRS already accepts that as a given.\n\n&gt; This only sounds like an argument because the person who uses it is hoping people will let their automatic negative reaction to theft override their emotions, hoping they will equivocate from theft as \"taking without permission\" to \"theft as a terrible act worthy only of criminals\".\n\n&gt; **Real arguments aren't about what words you can apply to things and how nasty they sound, real arguments about what good or bad consequences those things produce.**\n\nIf we agree that the use of taxed money saves lives, for example, then that can mean taxes, which are theft, are right, although theft in general is wrong."

You can show this with working too, but it's a little harder. College degrees also show that you can learn and apply knowledge, which is a little easier to branch into new fields of expertise. \n\nAs far as \"worth it\", college degrees on average have a 1.3 million dollar lifetime earnings more than their high school diploma coworkers. \n\nNOTE: I'm not downplaying Trade or Vocational schools.

Mrs. Clinton is a woman.\n\nI think that gives Clinton a bit of an advantage, but if you compare Sanders' policies to those of the GOP, Sanders' is much more aligned with centrist and liberal women's values.\n\n&gt; (4) Even if Hilary gaffes and scandals her way out of the nomination and hands it to Bernie on a silver platter, Republicans are going to have a field day turning this into a shit show.

For Sanders to have a chance he will need to have a large Obama-style group of volunteers to help get his message out, but he is on track to get those people.

Do you think people knew who John Kerry was? And yet even at this point, before everyone has announced their run, and before any debates, Bernie's support has grown dramatically. It's too early to say that he can't get his name recognition to the point where it needs to be.\n\n&gt;(2) Our economic problems aren't behind us by any stretch of the imagination, but we are slowly recovering and the media seems to be shifting its focus toward international affairs such as ISIL and Russia. Hilary has the advantage here as a former Secretary of State.

Most debates are about domestic policy, because that is the policy that affects most Americans, and despite the upturn in the economy, it's still pretty bad; furthermore, it's not just whether the economy is \"good\" or \"bad,\" but specifically what Americans are pissed about, struggling with, etc., and when it comes to income inequality, saving Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, taxing corporations and the wealthy, student debt, workers' rights, money in politics, and other related topics, Bernie has more credibility and, if nothing else, more exciting positions than Hillary.\n\nAs far as foreign policy goes, she may have an advantage, but Bernie taps into the large swath of the Democratic Party (and Republican Party) that thinks we should stay out of the Middle East and let them deal with their own problems. Anyone who thinks in that way will be fine with Bernie not having been Secretary of State; add to that the fact that he's the head of the Veteran's Affairs Committee, and he'll have plenty to say.\n\n&gt;(3) This one is a bit shaky, kinda sexist, and based on personal antidotes, but here it is. Mrs. Clinton is a woman. I remember in my class a few months back a straw pole my professor conducted an informal poll of who was going to voting for who and why. Almost unanimously (professor included) were in favor of voting for Hilary on the sole qualification that she was a woman and that would be good simply because it would signal to other women that they could have a career in politics. I don't necessarily agree with this mentality, but you can't argue that a lot of people will vote for her for that reason simply because of that \"progressive\" position.\n\nSome might, but [polls thus far don't show much of an advantage for her with women](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/07/10/1400974/-Bernie-Sanders-Breaks-20-in-a-National-Poll-for-the-First-Time-Gaining-Support-Across-Demographics).

Mud will be slung at the Radical Vermont Socialist who'll just continue Obama's policies. \n\nOf course mud will be slung, but do you not think they have mud on Hillary? Her favorability numbers have *plunged* since the GOP began going after her, and they've got *decades* worth of material to use on her. What have they got on Bernie? He's a self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist. But they already kind of used up the socialist thing on Obama, and it didn't work. The American people heard that Obama's policies are socialism and said, \"If so, I don't mind socialism.\" Granted, Bernie doesn't deny the socialist influence, but the policies of a Democratic Socialist country are not much radically different than our current system. Bernie just wants more government assistance for the poor, and less government assistance for billionaires. He's not trying to abolish capitalism. There will be mud slung, but he isn't afraid of his positions, and when people hear his positions, they tend to like them. Will he win the presidency? With this field of losers on the GOP side, I wouldn't count him out, but it's still too far out to guess: if I had to guess, I'd say no. But does he have a chance? Absolutely. He speaks in much the same way Obama spoke, and Obama was elected based on that rhetoric. He speaks in much the same way that FDR spoke, and FDR was our most popular president in history.\n\n**tl;dr** Without being a fanboy, you can admit that he has a chance."

Greece *has* implemented the demanded austerity measures for the last couple of years (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis_countermeasures) for all the boring glory). In fact, that's a big part of the problem! Those austerity measures drove the Greek economy deeper into recession, which is largely what increased the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio (after all, when GDP goes down, debt-to-GDP goes up even when debt stays constant).\n\nThe Eurogroup position is basically that of a doctor who sees that bloodletting fails to cure the patient, and therefore prescribes even more bloodletting.\n\nFor the less factual and more political things wrong with that sentence:\n\n&gt; defaulting on its debts and becoming a failed state\n\nA Greek default does not mean Greece becomes a failed state - look at Argentina for a good example. Of course, if Greece had exited, the rest of the EU may have been pushed by Merkel and Schäuble to start an even more vicious and open economic war against Greece.

Years ago, when the first haircut on Greek debt was decided, an investment plan for Greece could have been implemented to grow the Greek economy.\n\nActually, that would have been the *smart* move by the creditors, because it would have increased the changes that they would get paid back.

Also as far as care goes - we had several people with chemistry PhDs on our department who enjoyed being able to do firefighting as a hobby. That is actually a big deal. Fires are relatively rare in most places and are certainly rare in rural settings. We got maybe one or two working fires a year. Chemical spills and exposures were more common. Having multiple experts on that front made it really easy to react quickly and properly without having to look up chemicals. Very few professional firefighters could tell you about the toxicity of chlorine trifluoride vs sodium chlorine off the top of their head but when a tanker spills that's the kind of information you want fast.\n\nConversely a number of the local professional departments were staffed primarily by idiots.

However, if you pull a lever, the train will change directions and go on the second route, killing only one. Your only option is changing the tracks. What do you do...change or not?

One track, train heading down and it is going to hit 5 people. However, you are standing on a hill next to a really fat man. If you push the man down the hill, he will stop the train, but he will die. It is still 5 lives for the cost of one....do you push him?

Thousands or millions of soldiers are killed; not the \"elder oaks and maples\", but young men and women, often still in their teens. Similar numbers of innocent civilians - men, women, and children - are killed or displaced. You can see the survivors in refugee camps the size of cities, fighting against disease and malnutrition. \n\nWar is not a forest fire that allows for new growth. It scars the land and its people. Minefields from wars of decades past still kill. Adults and children alike maimed by bombs or bullets must still live with their disability. Think of the lost opportunity, the potential scientists and poets killed in war. Think of the effort spent in constructing a building and the effort spent in making a bomb and how when they come together all that's left is rubble. That is not progress. \n\nTalking about war as a \"natural process\" that \"eradicates old growth\" and contributes to \"human evolution\" is, I think, an overly romantic view of war. We too readily ask others to die for what we believe. Even if you are risking your life yourself, no one fights a war alone, and most of the victims never ask for it. Often we pump ourselves up with bravado and we don't look to the more difficult but peaceful solutions. \n\nIf you have a few minutes I'd suggest you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH3-Gt7mgyM), the last few minutes of *Blackadder*, a British comedy series.

    "prompt": "Nuclear reactors *if handled correctly* should be used more openly as a power source.",
    "chosen": "The fundamental issue is that nuclear power has *never been* economically viable. Nuclear power companies have never been able to pay for the costs of their operations, cradle to grave. The research, the safety engineering, construction the costs borne by neighbors, insurance, and especially the costs of disposing of nuclear waste have *never* been borne by the nuclear power industry. It has always been subsidized, in some cases 100% subsidized, by states interested in the potential of nuclear power. There was some hope that eventually costs would decline and it would be viable on its own (this has happened in the solar industry), but no such luck.\n\nRemember thay even though there have only been 3 major nuclear disasters, there are only about 400 nuclear power plants worldwide. That suggests the rate of failure of nuclear power plants is a bit lower than 1%, but that is misleading because many of those plants are relatively new (I think about half built since Chernobyl), so the true rate could be as high as 2-5%.\n\nBut even a 1% rate is horrendous because, as we have known since Chernobyl, the consequences of a meltdown can be stupendously bad. The epidemiology of cancers associated with the Chernobyl fall-out plume is heart-breaking. The area around it has been abandoned and returned to wilderness.\n\nThe nuclear industry's argument was that that sort of think might happen in Russia or a third-world country, but (minus growing pains like Three Mile Island) Western engineering and safety standards would keep us safe. Fukushima disproved that assertion: no country has more technical and industrial expertise with nuclear than Japan, and their safety standards failed to withstand extreme events.\n\nSo here are the facts. Nuclear has never been any good, purely as an economic proposition; we pay tax money (and other non-monetary costs) for the privilege of buying market-rate kW from nuclear companies. Nuclear power plants seem to be prone to disaster at unknown rates: 1%? 5%? It is clear that meltdowns can be very bad - Chernobyl could have been much worse. It is also clear that \"it can't happen here\" fails as an argument; it could happen anywhere. Since nuclear power is a value-losing proposition to begin with (we pay subsidies for kW we could get at the same price from other forms of power), there is no way to compare the value of nuclear power to estimates of the expected costs of future reactor meltdowns. Therefore, there are strong reasons to retrench on nuclear power: definitely in cases where the reactor hasn't been built yet, possibly in cases where some of the sunk costs have already been lost.\n\nYou say that nuclear power functions normally under the same conditions as other power plants, but you seem to be neglecting that when a coal, solar, wind, or hydro plant malfunctions, you lose power but you don't have nuclear contamination, endless clean-up costs, and cancer to worry about.\n\n(And to my friends with the downvotes, maybe you would be more happy discussing nuclear energy on /r/politics ? )",
    "rejected": "Accountant here. Let's assume that the waste and safety issues for nuclear power are solved (and I firmly believe that they can be solved!)- even then, they are insanely expensive. Governments and firms will have to sink billions of dollars into facilities, employee training, extensive security measures, and many other costs before they'll be able to generate clean power. No one has that kind of moolah lying around- you're talking about insane quantities of debt, and decades before the generator recovers its costs. \n\nThe interest costs alone on the debt would be astronomical. Add to that the fact that you don't know when you're going to start to see profit from the plant's operations. What if construction takes longer than expected? What if you face difficulties in training employees to a proper safety level? What if local municipalities oppose the plant? All these things add up to *delays.* That's a very bad thing when you have to make interest payments every three or six months. And I can't think of a bigger economic and social nightmare than a bankrupt, half-built nuclear power plant.\n\nOh, and even if the plant DOES get built, the fuel isn't gonna be that much cheaper. Think of all the engineers and technicians you have to pay to keep the plant running safely. And the insurance. And the waste disposal. And those interest costs aren't going anywhere either. \n\nIt's not that good of a fuel from an economic standpoint. "

Imagine your range of emotion as a gallon jug for water, and sometimes it's very full, and you're bursting with joy and energy, and other times it's nearly empty, and you feel like doing nothing but crawling into bed and pulling up the covers.\n\nWhen someone suffers from clinical depression, instead of a jug of water, they have a simple 20 ounce water bottle.  And while the container is *smaller,* the amount of water you need to reach emotions *doesn't change.*  They can be hanging out with friends doing something that they'd normally enjoy, and still feel \"normal,\" because their capacity is reached.  You know when you see something slightly amusing online, and you just smile a bit, or breath out through your nose in amusement? Imagine that was 99% of your capacity to laugh.  Depressed people can still occasionally be amused, but the emotion is often mild and fleeting.  They can laugh from time to time, but without utterly losing themselves in that moment of carefree joy the vast majority of us experience when we do so.\n\nThis is just one aspect of depression, but it should serve to describe a bit better why your perception, which is indeed the common one, is a bit off.  People who are truly clinically depressed are not \"comfortable but unfulfilled.\"  Anyone who's unemployed but being supported by family/friends could be described as \"comfortable but unfulfilled,\" but most psychiatrists would not call them depressed simply because they have no motivation or feel \"directionless,\" even if those things result in a low self-esteem.",

There is set guidelines for diagnosing depression. It is not just a \"oh you are sad you must be depressed\" diagnosis. They are based on the  DSM-IV/V guidelines and must meet specific criteria.\n\n&gt; I believe that many doctors give out anti-anxiety, anti-depressants, and ADHD medicine too freely when these issues are normal parts of growing up and do not require medication in all but the most extreme cases.\n\nAgain, source? Also, do you mind providing your medical expertise credentials on that only in the extreme cases do they require medication? \n\n&gt; I think that most people who are depressed are depressed because they have been thinking negatively for a long time, thus changing their brain chemistry. I think that a new outlook on life combined with a better and more fulfilling life may lead to a healthier mental state.\n\nOnce again, source? \"I think\" is not scientific of medically acceptable evidence so unless you have some peer reviewed sources on this claim, it simply is your perspective of how things are. And again, do you mind explaining your credentials/expertise into the evolution of brain chemistry in people who think negatively? I say this because throwing around phrases such as that is meaningless unless sources are provided.\n\n&gt; I think too many people think they are depressed for societal reasons and personal reason, and that they are not truly depressed in a clinical manner (requiring medication).\n\nBeing depressed for societal or personal reasons **is** being depressed in a \"clinical\" manner.\n\n&gt; I think that living an unexciting life full of only netflix, video games, work, alcohol, and television (be honest, this is most of all young people's existence between the ages 13-22) and work/school really isn't that fulfilling on a personal level unless you have some professional success or personal success. I think being out of shape and having no personal goals (many young people end up working a job they honestly don't care all that much for unless they go to college) beyond having fun this weekend is a new cultural norm that basically equals having a shitty life, despite comfort. I think that people raised in the late 80s and 90s (and now the 2000s) are told that they are good enough throughout childhood, and then are abruptly left hanging in their teens, a time of hormonal changes.\n\nI'm confused how this changes the fact that someone can be clinically depressed? Depression results from a combination of many factors or which societal, social, etc. can all be factors. It seems you have a very narrowed view and a limited scope into what depression actually is and how it effects people."

That doesn't stop science from working on improving health, any more than it would stop science from working on improving well being, but morality is exactly that value judgement of what we \"should\" value. The analogy isn't in any way analogous, because it operates at the wrong level. Now, he may take \"valuing well-being\" as an axiom, of course, but how would science tell you whether that's the right axiom, vs., say deonotological metaethics?\n\n2) Again, a disanalogy, because the entire point of morality is to define what \"wrong\" is with respect to multiple people interacting. If someone doesn't care about his health, this impacts largely just him. There's no need to persuade him about this (unless you think you're morally obligated to :-), so it appears that this isn't a problem in the case of health. But in the case of morality, it's a huge problem.\n\n3) The \"measurement\" problem with moral reasoning via utilitarianism isn't just about whether well-being can be measured itself (though it's an entirely subjective thing, so you're never going to be able to get better than a statistical measure, which may lead to immoral results in individual cases). \n\nIt's about whether an individual can, even in principle, determine the utility outcome of some action he proposes to take. If your only moral principle is maximizing well-being, then people are put into the position of having to determine all of the outcomes of their actions ab initio, which is strictly impossible. \n\nKilling Hitler as a child would have vastly improved world-wide well being (I'm not saying that WWII wouldn't have arisen without him, but the presence of a charismatic leader at that time made the rise of fascism much faster and more effective than it would have been without him). But by what possible means could any person have possibly determined that this would be the case, and in any event why would their opinion about this be an overriding consideration, and what if people disagree?\n\nI'm actually surprised that anyone would take this approach to the interaction of morality and science in the first place.\n\nMorality, from a scientific (i.e. what \"is\") viewpoint, is nothing more than a trick some species have evolved in order to gain the benefits of living in societies and thereby surviving better and increasing their proportion of the ecosystem. \n\nSaying that \"well being\" is the moral value that science should pursue seems to be a complete non sequitor from a scientific point of view. Indeed, evolution says absolutely nothing about \"well-being\", but only about gene frequencies. \n\nFrom a scientific viewpoint, the measure of morality should be what makes us successful as a species.

As a parent, you might want your daughter on a boy's team in order to expose her to better, more experienced, and potentially more demanding play.\n\nThis is especially true when you consider most peoples' varying approaches to encouragement between boys and girls -- the way we push boys might arguably be better suited to competitive development and spirit.  If that proves true, it's another reason why girls competing in boys' leagues is a good idea.\n\nAll anecdotal and, again, DA, but my own source is having played competitively on women's sports teams and spent my younger years on some boys teams before reaching an age where the girls'/women's teams finally became competitive.  I found these endeavors more fruitful as the girls' programs approached closer the boys' ones I played on as a kid in terms of coaching style, quality equipment, parental involvement and community support.",

By law, a school-sponsored club cannot discriminate based on sex. There cannot be girl sports and boy sports. There can be separate *teams*, but you can't forbid girls from playing football, and if there aren't enough volunteers to start a girl's league, you have to let them onto the regular team (or at least get a **fair** tryout)."

    "chosen": "Personally, I think that different people are influenced by a ton of different factors when they interact with new people. Attractiveness is certainly one of them, but I wouldn't personally go so far as to put it at the top of the list. Here are a bunch of factors that I think on a subconscious level would sometimes qualify above attractiveness when they are determining how they should first interact with a stranger:\n\n- Age (Is this stranger close in age to me? Are they an adult? child? infant? elderly?)\n- Gender/Sex (Is this stranger a member of the same sex? Are they a member of the sex I am attracted to? If they are not a member of the sex you are attracted to do they appear to be vying for the attention of someone in particular that I am attracted to?)\n- Race (Is this person from the same race as me? Do I have any subconscious bias for or against the race the stranger is from? Do I have an overt fear of their race?)\n- Language (Does they speak the same language as me? Will there be a communication barrier?)\n- Disabilities (Should I treat this stranger differently because they have a disability that would require me to compensate for the way I normally interact with strangers? Are they blind? Are they in a wheelchair? Do they look like they have down syndrome?)\n- Status (Does this stranger look wealthy? poor? famous? homeless?)\n- Body Language (Does this person look like they want to be approached? Do they look threatening?)\n- Cognitive State (Does this person look drunk? Do they look baked? Do they look like they are tripping on LSD? Are they in a state where I should be calling an ambulance? Do they look sober?)\n- Facial Expression (What emotions are their facial expressions conveying to me? Are they smiling? Do they look angry? Does it look like if I were to approach them that they would react favourably on unfavourably?)\n- Present Company (Is this person alone? Do they have other people around them? Do they appear to have a spouse with them at the moment?)\n\nEven if attractiveness ranked above some of these factors in some instances, I still think it would be faulty to claim that it is the single most important trait in determining how a stranger would treat you. These factors clearly play a pretty large role in people's day to day interactions and our brains are not as simple as your thesis makes them out to be. Individual people are more complex than that, and masses of people are more diverse than that.\n\nI don't mean to come off as rude when I say this, but it might sound that way because tone is difficult to translate into text so please keep that in mind as I ask he next question. Is it possible that you are simply projecting? Perhaps because being attractive is the most important trait in how you treat strangers you are simply assuming that others are doing the same when it simply isn't the case? And if I am incorrect in assuming that you don't practice this behavior yourself, why wold you assume that other people do when you don't?",

    "prompt": "When captured and convicted, SWAT \"pranksters\" should receive extremely harsh sentences",
    "chosen": "I just finished a Law test which included sentencing, so I could shed some light on why it is a bad idea.\n\nI'm no expert on the crime specifically, but I'll start by discussing deterrence as a sentencing rationale. \n\nDeterrence, for anyone who can't figure it out, is punishing more than someone deserves as a means of scaring others into not committing the crime. It is a good method, as huge punishments for petty crime generally do deter people from committing it (to an extent). However it is extremely unjust to give huge punishments for petty crime, because (in reference to your suggestion) you are giving them a sentence length equivalent to violent crime and even murder. If you can achieve deterrence then it is obviously a positive, as less people are going to commit the crime. But there are many problems with it, which is why it is almost never used and when it is used, it gets a negative backlash (Look at the war on drugs, mandatory minimum sentences etc). \n\nIt assumes many things - that the criminal expects to get caught, that the authorities actually catch these people often. If the apprehension rate is low, which it is for this crime, then people aren't going to be scared of getting caught and the punishment won't matter. It also requires good publication of the sentences given, because if people don't know the punishment given out in practice then they won't care. It also arbitrarily punishes someone more than they deserve, which goes against many sentencing principles in western criminal justice systems. This is more for violent crime, but people usually weigh the severity of the crime over the length - so a harsher punishment will be better than a longer one. \n\nThe biggest factor is that they don't expect to get caught, which makes the punishment irrelevant. \n\nIndividual rights are hugely important here too. I'll discuss a few of the relevant criminal justice system principles which are consistent across western societies.\n\n* The principle of minimum criminal punishments. This ties in with the idea that penal punishments should be avoided if possible, because jail heavily restricts established individual liberties. Deterrence goes against this entirely, as you are extending the restrictions on ones liberties based off of actions that others could commit. You are essentially taking punishment for what others haven't even done yet, which is bad policy. \n\n* Proportionality - the punishment should fit the crime. Years of jail time are far more (Taking into account restriction of personal liberties) than this crime generally deserves. \n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that courts do take into account aggravating and mitigating factors on a case by case basis. If Swatting resulted in injury, an unusually large amount of resources being wasted or unusually large amounts of psychological damage then they would aggravate the sentence.\n\nIf there are many crimes being committed at once when swatting then it could make for a big punishment. This is why some IT crimes can amount to huge sentences in comparison to something which is seemingly worse, like murder. The IT crimes are usually many crimes being committed together, where as murder is the singular sentence. \n\n**tl;dr** - Deterrence doesn't really work. It relies on the fact that people expect to get caught, which they don't. It also violates many sentencing principles. ",

AFAIK, some states don't even have a legally-distinct category for \"rape\", and all victims of rape, whether male or female, whether penetrator or penetrate-ee, are to prosecute the crime as 'sexual assault'.\n\nSo I guess the real question is which definition you want to amend, and why. Is it the colloquial definition of \"rape\" in English usage which should entail both? Or would it be satisfactory if English speakers retain different terminology for the different kinds of attacks, as long as in court they are punished with commensurate severity?\n\nIf you just want the FBI themselves to get with the damn times, I think everyone already agrees on that; *no one* takes their stats seriously.",

    "chosen": "(First, please note I'm talking in generalities; of course everything has an exception, so when I say \"rapists\", I'm using shorthand for \"most rapists\")\n\nI can see your point of confusion, and I think it stems from slight semantic trickiness. When people say \"rape is about power, not sex\", they're not saying it's not about sexual gratification for the rapist. They're saying the rapist derives sexual gratification from taking power. It's almost like saying \"rapists have a power fetish\", if that makes sense. \n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. Many rapists are not by any means sex-starved. They have spouses, significant others, etc. In fact, many rapists actually have MORE sex than the average person. It's just that that type of sex doesn't satisfy them.\n\n2. It's safe to say that most people want sex, in one way or another. But I would posit that very few people want the kind of sex that rape entails. To use gendered language for a moment, I doubt most men would be attracted to a struggling, despondent woman; in fact, I'd suggest they would be actually repulsed and unable to 'peform'. In order to be a rapist, it requires being attracted to and turned on by dominating other, i.e. having power.\n\nThink of it like this: I can imagine a situation where I was hungry enough to steal, or angry enough to kill. But I can't imagine a situation where I wanted sex bad enough to rape, because, as badly as I've wanted sex as, say, a nerdy teenager, the thought of raping someone actively repulses me. I think most people are the same way (and I would argue that on an instinctive level, is why we treat rapists so harshly, because it's the one crime most people can't relate to).\n\nI will admit that I do think there are exceptions to the rule, most notably cases of rape where the victim is intoxicated; I think this CAN come from guys who want sex and don't understand that this situation is rape, not sex, due to, as you said, rape culture. But I think you could safely say \"MOST rape is about power\", and have the statement be correct, in the sense that rape is a specific sexual desire motivated by power.",
    "rejected": "You're misunderstanding the point. (Which isn't your fault. Lots of people do.) Rape does of course fulfill sexual urges, which is why rapists choose to rape people rather than do some other violent crime. The question is *why* rape is such a big deal. \n\nWe used to think that it was just because of the sex; there was some sort of sexual innocence or purity that the rapist destroyed. But this implies that women who have been raped are somehow less innocent or less pure, and makes it very difficult to argue that marital rape or male-victim rape are real. \n\nWe now think that's horrible, but we still oppose rape just as much. So where does the issue really lie? People have a right to control their own sexuality, and rapists violate that by asserting the *power* to control other people's sexuality. Rape is a serious crime because we think that this is an important right, not because there's something magical about sex."

The resale price of a game you can sell is factored into the original price they can sell the game at when it is new. i.e. I bought Skyrim for XBOX 360 at $40, then I resold it at $30 when I was done. I might not have been willing to pay a full $40 if I knew I could not resell. \n\nThis is also why (I speculate) Valve is so reliant on deep discounts as part of their business model: buyers know they can't resell rights to the game, so their willingness to pay is lower.\n\nMaybe an example from another industry will help make this point stronger: used cars. Do you think that used car sales are unethical to car companies? I think car companies are actually very happy about used car sales, because it means if they produce a quality product they can sell it for more... Cars with a reputation for reliability keep their used value higher, and buyers factor in resale values when deciding whether or not to buy new. I don't think video games are any different.\n\nTLDR game companies do make money, indirectly, from used game sales - they just capture that in the original selling price. It's also a strong incentive to invest a lot into making a good game. \n\nPiracy gives nothing to the company, and creates incentives to skimp on game costs or collect fees through addons and DLC, which makes gamers unhappy.

Did I commit a morally objectionable act by buying a used house? Would it have been less morally objectionable if I had stolen the deed to the house?\n\nI guess my questions to you would be: \n\n1) Why would a software developer have different rights than say, a car manufacturer when it comes to re-selling a product that was purchased in a capitalistic economy?\n\n2) If a software company uses computers that they purchased from a computer manufacturer to develop software, would the computer manufacturer have a right to a slice of the profit from the games developed?

Because of this, the Canadian economic, educational, and legal systems aren't built on shared identity and trust, but rather on a sort of consequentialist pragmatism. Canada tends - in general terms, over a multi-decadal time scale - to adopt policies that work and discard ones that don't.

Why can't the Anglosphere be a perfect example of society as well?\n\nSecond I'd challenge your beliefs on feasibility. Not only must a country or autonomous region be small enough for local government to be smart and deliberate with their planning (which I fully support) they must also have the proper culture of anti-corruption, public spirit, and pragmatism. This kind of culture is conducive to an efficient and trusted state but doesn't happen everywhere (for example Chinese local government are very corrupt, inefficient with their money, and downright irresponsible, but Swiss local governments are the exact opposite). These countries also have the history of democracy, moderation, and pragmatism that many others do not (or at least not yet such as African, Asian, an d Latin American countries).

    "prompt": "Steve Jobs is not an innovator but a thief and does not deserve his recognition as a \"genius\". CMV",
    "chosen": "Steve Jobs came up with the radical notion that computers could be household appliances rather than tools for highly-trained engineers.\n\nFor decades, he drove company after company into the ground in pursuit of this ideal.  In the end, it came back to Apple, and he finally made it work [fifteen years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac)\n\nDid he design the iMac?  No, but he recognized that [an obsessively minimalist mechanical engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive) could succeed where an endless string of \"human interface\" designers had failed.\n\nDid he code [XNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU) (the core of OS X)?  No, but he recognized that the kernel of an operating system was critical to its success, and Mach was a better kernel than anything NeXT or Apple could create in any realistic amount of time.\n\nDid he design the iPhone?  No, but he recognized that people wanted to carry fewer devices, not more, and drove a team of 1,000 engineers to take the capabilities of a large tablet (the original project would have closely resembled the iPad) and [distill it down to a mobile phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_iPhone#Origins).\n\nDid Steve Jobs steal ideas from other companies?  Oh yes.  Oh *my* yes.  Most of the [ideas he took from Xerox PARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_%28company%29#The_GUI) were ideas that they had failed to develop and were essentially giving away anyway.  The tech industry is essentially a big clusterfuck of \"what can we get away with\", so being a thief doesn't make Steve Jobs stand out.  What makes him stand out was how *good* he was at it.\n\nTL;DR: Steve Jobs knew what people wanted, even if he didn't know how to make it.",
    "rejected": "If you define \"invent\" as strictly as the maker of that youtube video, then nobody has ever invented anything. By that videos logic Ford never did anything but combine things he saw somewhere else in order to make them more efficient. The same goes for the wright brothers. Wings existed, so did engines and seats. That video is nothing but trollbait. You can't name a single invention that wasn't based on previous ones besides the wheel and fire. Try it yourself. Who invented the computer? Who invented the internet? Nobody did. They were team efforts that each relied on each other to support each other in forming a technology. But this doesn't change that certain people were instrumental in steering that effort in a direction.\n\nAs CEO of a company, you have final say over everything. You decide what does and doesn't get through the approval process. You decide what to spend money on and what not to spend money on. You decide who to promote and who to fire. You decide so much that is so very relevant. Take [Jony Ive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive). He is a famous designer, known for his designs of the ipod/macbook/iphone/ipad. When Apple was close to bankrupt, Jony Ive worked for Apple but was a nobody. When Steve Jobs returned Jony Ive was given more and more responsibility because he was obviously a design genius.\n\nWhat about Pixar or Next? These two companies were touched by Steve Jobs and all of a sudden they were money making machines. Was that purely a coincidence? No. Steve Jobs had business insight and was the annoying perfectionist who knew better than others. You might ask: why does it matter whether he was a good businessman? Well, he wasn't just a good businessman, he was a good businessman and a good judge of products. (and that matters) He knew which to push for and which to dismiss and not invest in. \n\nOne anecdote that comes to mind is when Steve Jobs got to see a finished iPhone. He was really mad at the touchscreen, which was made of plastic. He was absolutely adamant that regardless of the cost it needed to have a glass screen. The engineers told him it couldn't be done, but he said they would have to do it anyways. Then he got into contact with [corning glass](http://www.corning.com/index.aspx), who had an unused technology which they invented 25 years ago for a certain type of scratch resistant glass. Now look at us! Plastic touch screens have gone the way of the dodo and corning glass is now known mainly for their smartphone glass which is used in almost all smartphones and tablets.\n\nLets talk about tablets. Did you know that Windows XP was a tablet OS? Perhaps you did know and proudly flaunt that fact whenever someone tries to say that Apple is so cool for inventing tablets. Anyways; the idea of tablets existed for many decades, and Microsoft made that idea a reality. You know what happened? They failed miserably. They failed so badly that when Apple brought out their tablet Microsoft was confident in the knowledge that people didn't want tablets. Windows tablets were big, heavy, and had a normal CPU architecture. They had the same interface as the normal XP and required use of a stylus. Finger usage of the touchscreen was next to impossible. Apple didn't invent the tablet, but they did make the first one people wanted. Microsoft knew that tablets were the future but they failed at realising them. The same with the iPhone. Apple didn't invent smartphones, but they did make one that was crazily different from everything else and which caused a massive shift in future smartphones. Ever since the iPhone smartphones have been all about touchscreens, apps, and simple to use finger interfaces. Before this wasn't even close to the case, and today you can't whip out a phone without a touchscreen and call it a smartphone.\n\nDo you know what happened the first time Apple tried to make a phone? They cooperated with Motorola in order to combine their strengths and make a good phone. [It completely failed because it was a piece of shit.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_ROKR_E1#E1) Make no mistake about it, the ROKR was made by the same engineers who worked on the iphone. When they made the iphone however, Steve had a different mindset.  \n&gt;*Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that having to compromise with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make.*   \n\nIf anything the ROKR proves that it isn't just about the people working on a project that matter but that the leadership also matters in steering the people a certain way. \n\nI'm certain that had Steve Jobs not given Corning a call someone else would have a couple of years later. If he wouldn't have funded the engineer who said \"what about an OS for a phone?\", someone else would have made a smartphone OS. I am certain that had the iPhone never come out we would still eventually be using touch gestures on everything. I also know that had Ford not innovated with the assembly line we would still have assembly lines today and the same goes for the Wright brothers and their air travel. Sometimes we know what the future holds. I know that in the future personal air travel will be widespread. I don't know how this will be possible, and if I did I would be rich. Therein lies the difference.\n\nInnovation is progress. We like to see technological innovation as massive sudden explosions of inventions, but that isn't the case at all. 99.99% of the time it is a process which builds on the works of others. This requires great insight and decisiveness. This is what Steve Jobs had and used. This is why he is so hyped as an innovator. Perhaps the future of touch interfaces and devices was inevitable. Perhaps any possible timeline would end up with smartphones. But Jobs was the man who made a lot of it happen by purely making the right decisions and many times forcing those decision on those below him who didn't believe in them. \n\nInnovation can definitely be taking things that exist and combining them in such a way to create something new and revolutionary. Steve Jobs was someone who had a talent in imagining what a product had to be in order to succeed and he did have a very top down leadership approach which ended up with him being very intimately involved in all of Apples products during his reign as Apple CEO. Steve Jobs is a notable exception in that he was one of the only CEOs who was personally involved in creating new ideas/patents and his name is still on plenty of patents to prove it.\n\nI leave you with these two quotes\n\n1. **Bill Gates:** [“Steve was an incredible genius who contributed immensely to the field I was in.\"](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/bill-gates/9041726/Bill-Gates-I-wrote-Steve-Jobs-a-letter-as-he-was-dying.-He-kept-it-by-his-bed.html)\n2.

Errors in both directions - overestimation and underestimation - could result hundreds of millions of needless deaths.\n\nThe sheer magnitude of the stakes is what motivated me to do my best to dig into the empirical evidence, and I hope you have the same experience.",

Don't you care about the survival of humanity, even after you are gone? It seems kind of important.\n\n&gt; However, empirical questions like global warming are less interesting to me\n\nMost scientists will tell you that science is extremely interesting and awesome. But they are a bit biased, because they have already done all the ground work to get to the point where they can enjoy science. The truth is that science is hard and for somebody with no experience it can be difficult to like it. There might be a lot of beauty and understanding in a complex equation in physics, but if you show it to the layman they will say \"Ugh.. Not mathematics again..\"\n\nThe reason to do all this boring mathematics and tedious empirical research is that it gives us more accurate answers to our questions than other more interesting methods. Philosophers have been discussing the nature of the universe for thousands of years - and some of those discussions are extremely interesting and logical, and making sense, and explaining things.. It's fun reading and studying it. Yet... They were mostly wrong about almost everything. It is only now, with modern science (and all the boring maths coming with it) that we are able to start understanding some of those issues and get accurate answers.\n\nWhere do men and the animals come from? Why are they the way they are? What are we made of? How and when was the Earth created? What are those things in the sky and why do they move? So many questions people have been wondering for thousands of years, now finally answered by science. If the price for that is to do some boring maths, so be it.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of scientists and scientific work agrees that there is global warming and that it is caused by us, and that it will lead to problems. When there is such strong consensus, you need to accept that this is what science tells us. The best thing to do is to do some studying and understand the evidence yourself. That will require a lot of effort, especially if you don't find it interesting, but in the end you will have better understanding. If you don't want to do it, that's fine.. But then you have to accept what the people that have done it say."

    "chosen": "You have a lot of various issues in your post OP, but I'd like to hit the major ones you have mentioned. As a white 30 year old man, I can assure you things aren't easy for us either. It's not easy for anyone, and each race, sex, sexual orientation, etc, has it's own challenges and difficulties in life. \n\n&gt; Nobody is afraid of women. If I go out late at night, there has to be a trusted man with me. There are rapists at night, or if I get into an accident, who's going to change my tire? If I want to go travel extensively in a foreign country, especially the considered \"third world\" country, it's too dangerous. I am a woman, and I am American, and everyone knows how to to take advantage of that.\n\nAs a man in my thirties, if I were to interact with a woman I didn't know either at a bar, or the supermarket, or at work there's immediately the assumption that I am simply trying to \"get with them\". A guy cannot simply be nice to a woman without there being some preconceived notion that it's an attempt at wooing the particular individual. Likewise, if I attempt to help someone out of the goodness of my heart say if they have a broken down on the side of the road or they are visibly lost in a city at night, there's the assumption that I am simply going to try and harm them. People are scared of men. It doesn't matter for race or age, if you're a guy and you're interacting with a woman who you don't know, there's a danger sense women put forth which is entirely unfair, it makes sense, but it's still unfair. \n\n&gt; If I sleep around, I am a slut. If a man sleeps around, he is a stud. No one gets very angry if a man abandons the baby he fathered. Yet, if I a woman knows that she won't be able to handle this baby, or if it was born out of rape, there are plenty of states where I wouldn't be able to abort it. If I even have sex with one person before they commit their entire being to me (aka: marriage), it's a risk. What if a mistake happens and I get pregnant?\n\nThere is one issue in regards to sex and men, and that issue is that men have to be the sex fiends that most see us as being. We need to want sex all of the time. We need to want to have sex with as many woman (or guys if you're gay) as possible. This fact is punched into our skulls time, and time, and time again within the media, music, advertising, etc, etc. If a guy states he wants to wait to have sex, he's immediately seen as less than a man by pretty much everyone. If he wants to wait to have sex until after marriage it goes so far as to others believing he's secretly gay. Men have the same issues and insecurities about sex as women, but unlike woman we're not allowed to voice them. If we voice our insecurities, we're seen as a lesser individual or even worse, a worse dating/relationship prospect.\n\nThen it also comes down to the issue regarding pregnancy. A lot of the blame is put on guys when it comes down to sex and getting woman pregnant. As the old saying goes, it takes two to tango. There are plenty of men out there who are told and reassured by woman that she is \"on the pill\", but either the woman takes the pill incorrectly or lies about it in general. In the realms of the court, men are still to blame when the woman gets pregnant. Yes, there's condoms, but people forget in the heat of the moment. Men can push all they want to make the right decision for that couple and unborn child (adoption, abortion, etc), but in the end the courts always fall in favor of the woman. This is including parental custody, and it is harder for a man to get custody than a woman. \n\n&gt; Men have freedom of opportunity. There are still many lucrative professions that are anti-women. Tech and Engineering are the most popular ones. I don't want to go in them, but I'm not sure if it's because of the societal view placed upon me, that I can not, or if it really is an independent choice. Some people may say that if I really wanted to, I could still be go into tech or engineering, but there are extra difficulties involved that make one ask -- is it worth it?\n\nThis isn't always true. Yes, maybe this is the case in the tech and engineering fields, but it's untrue elsewhere. I am a teacher, specifically a teacher for children with developmental disorders. There is a realm of my profession called \"intake\". What intake is, is when a child who's new to the program comes in, they determine the new educational and behavioral goals. In my particular school, because I'm a man I cannot work in this particular field. It's because if there's a female child who comes in, I cannot work with that new child. The reason? The preconceived notion that I could sexually assault her. That's fucked up, isn't it? \n\nBut, let's look at other realms where it's harder for men to work. Nursing is one of the biggest. Men are a very large minority in the nursing population. Our culture sees men as being the doctors and physicians, but if one goes into nursing they are seen as strange and not as good as a female nurse. Elementary teaching is another. In our culture men are supposed to do the hard labor, we're supposed to be doing the \"hard tasks\". If a man likes kids and wants to teach young children, the cultural stereotype is that he's immediately a pedophile. But, let's not also go into the fact there are men who are stay at home dads. That is an even bigger cultural no-no. \n\n&gt; Men aren't objectified. If I go anywhere looking fashionable and attractive, I will get harassed. If a man goes out with fashion and taste, he won't. (Chances are, that he won't, at least.) Even women see fashionable, tasteful women as bad for society; harlots.\n\nMen are objectified, and woman are worse at objectifying men than men are with woman. In the dating sphere, a man will date any woman he finds remotely attractive or who possesses those positive qualities a woman has. Woman, nope, woman for the most part have much higher standards. I wish I had a link to it, but the website OKCupid had a research article in regards to the topic. In their research, they found woman rate men worse than men rate woman, this means that woman place more emphasis on who they date based upon looks. Think about it. A guy has to have a certain height, weight, activity level, job description, etc, etc. Often, a man could attempt to woe a woman, and he could have all of the qualities as a woman looks for except one, and immediately he's put into a different category and he's no longer a dating prospect. But, though this isn't true for every woman or man, it's incredibly common. \n\nBut, then there's the media. Men are shown time and are led to believe time and time again to be muscle bound super macho types, and we're constantly led to believe that we're supposed to be those guys or we're lesser human beings. Our culture wants us to have six pack abs and be taller than six feet. We need to want to play sports, lift, and work out all of the time. If you look at any child's action figure, they are worse than Barbi in regards to physical proportion. Men are often always displayed having huge muscles and are incredibly fit. If you try finding an average looking action figure, good luck. \n\n&gt; (This one is a bit humorous, but still.) Men don't have periods.\n\nYeah, but men get erectile dysfunction. ",
    "rejected": "(1) Nobody is afraid of women\n\nOn the flipside, men have to live in constant fear of being maced or tazed at night if they approach a fearful woman. If a man is lost at night and he needs to ask for directions, good luck approaching the woman walking home from public transportation. This suspiciousness towards all men at night is somewhat irrational. If you are afraid of being raped, you should be more fearful of being taken advantage of by an acquaintance than a random stranger. The stats show that you are far more likely to get raped by someone you know than a random stranger. We think stranger rape is far more common than it actually is because of the \"availability heuristic\" noted by Daniel Kahneman - specifically that the news reports on stranger rape far more often because it is a \"scarier\" and thus more newsworthy story. \n\nBut the fact is, men are just as likely to get mugged at night. And muggings on the streets are more common than rapes on the streets. And at my undergrad campus, the university offered a service that would walk women home at night. The service theoretically may have been available to everyone, but it was far too socially unacceptable for a man to use it. Because of the attitude that men could just walk home alone safely. Even though the greatest risk in that neighborhood was getting robbed, not getting raped.\n\nAnd your argument about \"who will change your tire\" is backwards. An attractive female stranded at the side of the road is *far* more likely to get her tired changed by a helpful stranger than a man faced in the same situation. Sure, there is the \"stranger danger\" wariness, but you can only have that wariness because it is theoretically possible that a stranger would stop to help you. If a man's tire goes flat, it's expected that he knows how to change it himself. And no enterprising young men driving by are trying to get in his pants, so help is less likely to be forthcoming.\n\n(2) The Slut/Player Dichotomy\n\nThe reason a man is given congratulation for sleeping around is because it is difficult to do so. Women don't just sleep with every guy they meet. They only sleep with highly desirable men. So if a man sleeps around with a lot of women, he must be a very desirable mate. A women who sleeps around doesn't get to be a \"player\" because it is easy for women to have sex - they can go to any bar and find a willing partner within five minutes. The \"slut\" label may be unfair, but it is based on the jealousy of the sexual power that women have because they are the choosers. Saying you would rather be a man, sexually, is like saying that when you are interviewing for a job that you really really want, you would rather be the interviewee than the interviewer, who already has a job at the company and gets to choose the next co-worker. Being the chooser is much better than being the convincer - \"choose me, choose me.\" \n\nSure, abortions aren't available everywhere. But if you practice safe sex, there is almost no chance of getting pregnant (and if a condom breaks, there is the morning after pill). If you had to, you could travel to another state to get an abortion. Regardless, abortion is a two-way street, since a would-be father whose baby mama wants to get an abortion has no say in the matter.\n\n(3) Tech and Engineering\n\nBy the same token, there are *so* many special scholarships for you if you went into these fields, as a non-white female. As a white male, I will never qualify for 90% of the scholarships out there. When I was a 1st year in law school, there were law firms that were *only* hiring minorities for what they call \"diversity fellowships.\"\n\nAssuming you are born into a wealthy family, it is far better to be born a minority, at least in some professions. Because there are so many incentive programs to boost minority involvement in those professions. And if you are born wealthy, many of those \"barriers\" to entering those professions will be erased for you. Affirmative action at schools like Harvard and Yale tends to benefit only wealth minorities. If you were born into privilege, affirmative action amounts to - as Justice Thomas puts it - aesthetic color balancing. You benefit as a wealthy minority because employers and schools want to have the right racial mix, but they still need people will stellar grades, extra-curriculars, and summer experiences that only wealth enables.\n\n(4) Men don't get harassed. True. That's because women aren't dying to have sex with us constantly. Saying that it sucks to be a woman because men constantly holler at you is like saying that you wouldn't want to be an A-list movie star or athlete because the public constantly beg you for autographs. Every good thing has its downsides.\n\nRace\n\n(1) Not many non-white CEO's.\n\nNot that many minorities go to business school. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304830704577496901585090874.html This is likely due to socio-economics more than racism, since business schools would be happy to boost minority enrollment if they could. If a major company was choosing between two *equally* qualified CEO candidates, and one was white and other was minority, the minority would win every time. Because it helps the company's public image.\n\nThe above makes it hard for white people in government. For positions of prominence, the president and Congress want to appoint minority candidates. For example, a white male who is liberal is never going to get appointed to the Supreme Court. Those positions are going to go to women or minority judges. Appointing a white male, these days, to a privileged positions of prominence is seen as akin to being a racist. Because you, as the appointer, have the opportunity to fix centuries of racism. So where does that leave white males who aspire to un-elected positions of prominence in government?\n\n(2) Racism against non-whites.\n\nThere is still racism against black people. But there is not considerable amounts of racism towards Hispanics, Asians, Indian people, or Native Americans (at least on the West Coast, where I'm from). \n\nWhat you, OP, are describing in xenophobia - dislike of foreigners. And it's not irrational to want someone who speaks perfect English as an employee. It makes it easier to communicate, and customers prefer it. Regardless, this doesn't really support your premise. Anyone born in the US, regardless of race, will have an American accent if raised as a native English speaker and exposed to English speaking peers.\n\n(3) Too many Asians at top colleges.\n\nStudies of Affirmative Action show that it harms Asians *a lot*, whites a little, and massively benefits Hispanics and blacks. Studies have found that checking the box on your application that says you are black or Hispanic is equivalent to getting a 400 point boost on your SAT scores. So being white is not the best category in this regard. \n\nI personally think that being born as the wealthy son to a Native American casino baron would be the best position. But being a wealthy male Hispanic is a close second. At least as far as colleges are concerned.\n\n(3) Religious tolerance.\n\nI don't think anyone would argue that it's easier to live as a Middle Eastern practicing Muslim in the US currently than as a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP). But there are a lot of other races to choose from.\n\nIn conclusion, wealthy attractive Hispanic females are likely live much better lives than your average white male. Race and gender aren't everything."

Socialism and communism *mostly* care about the property of the *means of production*.\n\n&gt;That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”.\n\nIt's not like Tsarist Russia was better.

But yeah, it was obviously far from perfect.\n\nFunny how you never hear the same \"it doesn't work because we're not perfect\" with capitalism, though.\n\n&gt;All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc.\n\nThose are mere concessions pried with sweat by the workers from the State that oppresses them.",
    "rejected": "&gt; Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism [...]\n\nSocialism is by no means a precursor to anything, let alone communism. The notion of socialism preceding communism was a Marxist idea, probably propaganda, and is surely false considering the numerous countries that have successfully implemented democratic socialism, for instance: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Australia (formerly) and New Zealand (formerly). One could argue that the United States used to be a democratic socialist country following the New Deal reforms from 1933-38.\n\n&gt; [...] are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich.\n\nAgain, be careful not to confuse the very broad concept of **socialism**, encompassing ideologies ranging from social democracy to revolutionary socialism, with **communism**, which broadly encompasses Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, anarcho-communism and others.\n\n&gt; However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist.\n\nThis is incredibly broad and vague, but if you're referring to the collapse of numerous *communist* power structures, then this is probably more often than not due to the undermining of left ideologies through American foreign policy, especially in regard to countries like Cuba. Cuba is also worth assessing since it is a third-world country and still has a higher life expectancy and a more efficient and accessible health-care system than the United States.\n\n&gt; In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.\n\nNeither Russia nor China were socialist countries. It was their propaganda systems that declared themselves as socialist. For instance, nobody really believes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is democratic.\n\n&gt; First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.\n\nThis is *not* socialism. At all. You really ought to research socialism as a political theory for yourself, since this sentence mirrors the sound bites heard from the Cato Institute and AEI.\n\nAs your following points, these are predominantly tangents that have developed from your own misconceptions of socialism. Research socialism for yourself, away from the caustic, whiny student protestors and the conversely obnoxious right-wing jingoists and I think you'll find that it offers numerous palpable solutions to the ecological and economic crises that we face as a direct result of unrestricted neoliberalism."

    "prompt": "I believe people should be able to retire by the time they are 62 years old, and that their employers should be paying them well enough to do so. CMV",
    "chosen": "&gt; I believe people should be able to retire by the time they are 62 years old, and that their employers should be paying them well enough to do so.\n\nWould it change your view if I told you that already happens?\n\nLet's take an average \"low wage\" worker.  Federal minimum wage in the United States is currently $7.75/hr (I think).  But that certainly shouldn't be the lifetime wage of someone who \"works hard all their life\".  If you're making minumum wage when you're 30-35, that's a problem with *you*, not a problem with the employer.\n\nSo let's assume a typical \"low wage\" worker averages $10/hour throughout their lifetime (for [reference](http://ycharts.com/indicators/average_hourly_earnings), the current average hourly wage in the US is over $24.00).  On a 40 hour work week, that's $20,800/year or $1,733/month.  Can a person retire on that income at age 62?  I think the answer is yes.\n\nThe stock market has historically averaged an 8% return over the long term.  At that rate, if you can put in just $54/month (about 3% of your paycheck) for 44 years (from the time you're 18 until 62), you'll have around $262,000 when you turn 62.  And if you continue to earn 8% on that, you'll be earning $1,737/month in income - which replaces that $1,733 monthly income that you previously had from working.\n\nSo then the only question is whether or not people can live on $1,679/month ($1,733 in wages less $54 going to savings).  Obviously, different regions have different costs of living, but it is certainly possible to live in the United States on $1,679/month.  If you disagree with that, it is another discussion.\n\nWhen it comes to being able to retire at 62, **the problem isn't that workers aren't getting paid enough, it is that they have other priorities that are more important to them throughout their working years** and don't make saving for retirement a priority.  They don't save that $54.00/month.  They spend it on Starbucks and beer and cigarettes and cell phones and cable TV.  They spend too much on cars, clothes and housing when a less expensive alternative would let them save that $54.00.  They go gambling or take a vacation or rent a Jet Ski for a day.  They do a lot, but they don't save that $54 every month.\n\nAnd that's fine.  I'm not judging those folks.  If they want beer or cigarettes, if they want nicer clothes, if the Jet Ski was a blast - that's fine!  They should enjoy their lives and enjoy the fruits of their labor the way they see fit.  But it is those choices that mean they *can't* retire when they are 62 - not the low wages paid by their employer.\n\n**Edit:** I made my calculations above simplistic for the sake of demonstration.  Obviously, there are holes in it (inflation, lower earnings at younger ages make it hard to invest, etc.), but please don't let those detract from the point that I'm making - which is that if people just saved for retirment, they'd be able to retire at 62.  On the other side of the simplicity, I also didn't even consider social security income, inflation in wages and that most people who work consistently for 44 years are going to average much more than $10.00/hour.",

Any income that retired people have can only, ultimately, come from the people that are still working.\n\nHow many workers do you need to support 1 retiree? Well, let's say that every worker pitches in 10% of their income, and that retirees can live on half of what a worker can live on due to owning a home, having fewer expenses, etc., etc.\n\nThat would mean that you need 5 workers for every retiree, or the system simply can't support itself. \n\nThe consequence of that, though, is that the life expectancy of someone at retirement can't possibly go much higher than 1/5 of one's working life. If you start work after college, and work until you're 62, that's 41 years. \n\nThis means that your scheme can only possibly work, mathematically if people's life expectancy at age 62 is no more than 70.2 years, unless the working people are paying significantly more. If we take 20% of everyone's earnings, we could deal with life expectancy being 78.3 (which is about where it is today).\n\nIs it worth that? Well, perhaps, but you're not going to get the free money fairies to pay for it. Social security taxes would have to increase at least 50% above what they are at today. "

Then you go on to claim that all women are not as smart as men. Men do this and then forget about the over prevalent need to address social and cultural issues effecting women.

A direct translation usually isn't the best translation, since it can be very difficult to handle jokes, idioms, cultural references, writing/speaking style and accents.  A very good translation is usually also a *localization* that attempts to capture all of these things.  Even if you're a fluent speaker of two languages, you might not be *culturally* fluent enough to pick up on all of the little nuances.  For instance, you might not be able to pick up on little differences in American or British accents, which can be significant.  A good translation-localization will convert those nuances to something that will be more familiar to you. Out of the TV series you mentioned, I've only seen GoT, but I imagine that shows with more modern settings would benefit more from localization.\n\nOf course, good translation and dubbing are complicated and expensive procedures.  I'm not sure how it works in Germany, but in the US, there tend to be two kinds of dubs: the kind where all of the roles are dubbed by professional voiceover artists, and the kind where most of the main roles are dubbed by well-known English-speaking actors who usually don't have much experience doing voiceover work.  The dubs that use professional voiceover actors usually sound better.  There's a real art to voiceover acting, whether it's for a dub of a foreign production or the original of an animated production.  Because all of the actors are recorded in separate sound booths, often at different times, it takes a lot of skill from both the actors and the director to blend them into natural-sounding dialogue.  Anything that has to be re-rerecorded because it just doesn't sound right costs money, and often the budget for re-recording just isn't there.  That's why low-budget dubs (and cheap animation) usually sound so unnatural.  But high-budget dubs with professional voiceover actors and high quality translation-localizations (like Disney movies) usually sound *great*. \n\nIt's still fine to prefer watching stuff in the original language, but not *all* dubs are bad.

    "prompt": "Ending child pricing (or beginning adult pricing) at movie theaters at ages 13-16 doesn't make sense and is wrong",
    "chosen": "There are three justifications for the price differences for children under 13. \n\nFirst, teenagers and young adults attend the movies more often than any other demographic. That group is over represented - People from 12-18 represent only 8% of the population but represent 16% of the movie going audience and 18 to 24 year olds represent 19% of the audience but just 10% of the population.  However, children under 12 are underrepresented - they make up just 7% of the typical movie going audience while being 14% of the population. (By the way, these stats are from 2010 since I couldn't find anything more recent).  The only other group that is significantly underrepresented are seniors. \nSo the theater industry offers discounts to those underrepresented groups needs to incentivize them to attend. Thus, we regularly see discounts for senior &amp; children 12 and under at movie theaters.   However, since teenagers are showing up in numbers already, it doesn't make sense to target them with a discount. You want them paying full price.  \n\nSecond , as was mentioned above, is that a lower child price targets families. It's essentially making attending the movies as a family less expensive and thus more attractive option.  Other groups - a pack of teenagers for example - are less likely to consider the total cost for the group since they will be paying for their tickets individually. However,  families are going to be very aware of the total cost since they will not be paying individually.  And, they will be comparing that total cost against other entertainment options. So a teenager might be asking \"is it worth $15 bucks to see this movie with my friends\" while a family of four  is asking \"is $60 worth it to see this movie.\"  Once you start considering that total cost, it may not sound like much of s value. So, theaters improving that value proposition with a discount makes sense. \n\nFinally, I'd argue that in general the younger a person is, the less they get out of a movie. Now, that's not true for all movies. But, if a parent is considering attending let's say a typical drama, I think you would conclude that your 11 year old might not appreciate or understand that movie well enough to justify the $15 a full priced ticket will cost.  That is not to say the child won't get any enjoyment out of that movie, but a lower price might convince a parent to bring a child that they wouldn't for full price. Also, and I think more importantly, that parent might not attend that movie unless they can take their child (think single or stay at home parents, or just those unwilling to attend the movies without their children).  Now, like a said, I don't think this is true for every movie, but for certain movies a discounted child ticket price can be justified by young children being less able to appreciate those movies. \n\n\n ",
    "rejected": "It's about attracting customers. If a parent is going to take their kids somewhere, cost will certainly be a factor. If they have to pay full price for multiple tickets than it might make them choose somewhere else to go. By giving a discount for young kids they attract more business from parents. 13 or so is about the age kids start going to movies with friends instead of their parents. Sure they are still borrowing money from their parents, but now the few extra dollars for a ticket isn't as big of a deal since they are only paying for one ticket instead of 2 or 3 or however many kids they might have.

GM would probably pay the employees more, have better health care, and be more stable an a going concern because they have more resources to keep the place in business. \n\nAlso, Im sure you could get better deals from a GM owned dealership than you could from a local third-party owned dealership.  and if the public is getting better deals, that means they have more money to spend on other things, which is better for the economy.  particularly for people buying less expensive cars, because they are more likely to spend that money savings of other things which will help diversify the economy, and give them more ability to sustain their budgets.\n\nand even so, it is just morally bankrupt for a bunch of auto-dealers to band together to force a competitor out of the market. competition is good for society."

As great a guy as my dad is, he spouts complete rubbish when talking about politics and in particular, Obama. Since I've been following politics pretty closely for a while now, I've usually heard about the news he is talking about and usually from his end there's some sort of important misconstrued detail that makes Obama look evil. \n\nThe worst of it all, my younger brothers get the impression that Obama is bad because they hear my dad complain about him. And the same shit goes on in my school with other kids. Last year, we had a school vote just to see what way our school would swing in the election (it was Republican, by the way) and when talking to many of my friends, they often said \"I'm voting for Romney... because my parents don't like Obama.\" When I say why I like Obama, people often don't put up much argument. I feel like people just sort of support what their family wants them to support. It's like they agree with one side but vote for the other because they don't know what they're doing.\n\nI hear people say how abortion is so bad because it's \"killing a person,\" when they don't realize at all how simplified and nonsensical it is to use that as your argument. Or hear people who aren't even that religious make fun of gays because they know they should. Or hear people shout about how teachers should be paid as much as pro athletes without realizing how economics work in the slightest. Or hear people shout how all guns need to be banned because guns kill people, blah blah. Us highschool kids are great at making BS pseudo-logical arguments all the time. If your highschool friends agree with you, I doubt it hardly means much.\n\nNow I'm not saying Obama is some sort of god who is not allowed to be critiqued, he has most certainly fucked up (in particular, this second term), and I'm not saying Romney is some sort of shitbag that only politically uneducated support. I'm just saying that, especially in highschool, you tend to start listening to and understanding what your parents are saying about politics. And when you hear it from your parents, people whom you tend to trust greatly, you might just assume that it's true rather than looking into it and forming your own opinion... because they're your parents and they must know what's right, right?\n\nI'm also not saying you're one of those impressionable people, maybe you're just more republican, I don't know. But I know for a fact highschool kids tend to be notorious for taking sides in politics and not knowing why - other than the fact that their parents or someone said so.\n\nSorry, kinda got off on a tangent. Sometimes I just need to make it clear because I often don't trust people my age with holding a well-thought-out political conversation.

    "chosen": "This is a very common topic on [this sub] (https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3an3j3/cmv_i_believe_transgenderism_is_a_mental_illness/cse5qgp), so I'm just going to copy older responses to save time:  \n\n&gt;I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning  \n\nHere is an excerpt from a [textbook on neuro-biology explaining the modern scientific understanding of sex, gender, and gender identity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10943/):  \n\n&gt;&gt;Gender refers more broadly to an individual's subjective perception of their sex and their sexual orientation, and is therefore harder to define than genotypic or phenotypic sex. Generally speaking, gender identity entails self-appraisal according to the traits most often associated with one sex or the other (called gender traits), and these can be influenced to some degree by cultural norms. Sexual orientation also entails self-appraisal in the context of culture. For purposes of understanding the neurobiology of sex, it is helpful to think of genotypic sex as largely immutable, phenotypic sex as modifiable (by developmental processes, hormone treatment, and/or surgery), and gender as a more complex construct that is determined culturally as well as biologically.  \n\n# \n\n&gt;We, as a society, have decided that these are sick individuals who need medical and psychiatric attention. Certainly, an individual with alien hand syndrome could have a procedure to remove their hand in a safe and controlled environment and continue living a suitable life. We don't allow that, though. How is having gender identity issues different from afflictions I have described above?  \n\n[Gender dysphoria is already classified as a mental illness under the DSM V.](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) \n\n&gt;Also, why are these individuals allowed to make unnecessary changes to their body when we don't provide the same liberties to others?  \n\nBecause it works. [Here is a comment with multiple citations](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2o02ul/cmv_i_think_transgenderism_is_a_mental_health/cmih4oh) that show current medical understanding of trans issues and the treatment options, especially showing how transition is effective. It also addresses your \"alien hand syndrome\" comment and why treating that isn't comparable to transgenderism.  \n\nI'm reproducing the relevant parts below:  \n\n&gt;&gt;Two, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\n&gt;&gt;Compare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to both [therapy and SSRIs.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/)  \n\n&gt;&gt;Three, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.  \n\n&gt;&gt;This is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nThe linked comment addresses everything you've asked. You can also go to /r/asktransgender to talk to actual trans people. They've put together many links detailing this too.",
    "rejected": "You're right that transexuals have a type of body dysmorphic disorder. It totally sucks to feel like your body is completely wrong for you. If we could cure them with therapy or drugs, most of them would be happy to be cured of it. \n\nBut we don't understand neuroscience well enough to develop a cure yet. Counselling does very little to make them feel better. So instead, we use surgery and hormone replacement therapy. It's not ideal, but it makes them feel a lot better. Unlike people with untreated anorexia, bulimia, and other serious mental disorders, they go on to live happy and productive lives. Since it works, why argue with it?\n\nAs for body integrity identity disorder (alien hand syndrome,) there isn't really enough scientific consensus to support a particular treatment. Amputation is permanent, and there is a risk that the patient will develop phantom limb syndrome, or another psychological fixation in it's place. Hopefully, doctors will develop a working cure for these patients in the near future too. But right now, it seems like psychological therapy is the best option."

    "chosen": "Using a throwaway account for this. For context I'm a guy.\n\nI never say 'I was raped' if I tell anyone what happened. I use terms like sexual assault or avoid using a term at all. I don't remember how old exactly I was at the time, maybe sometime between the ages of 9 and 12? The other guy was a few years ~3-4 older than me. The stuff that happened felt physically good, even if it made me feel sort of weird, or wrong inside. It was like stealing money from a friend's mum's purse and buying sweets for you and your friend, you knew it was a bad thing to do but your friend would act like you were really cool for doing it and the sweets tasted nice, so it was okay right? We used to play a game, sort of a 'would you rather', it'd have lots of interesting questions in their but eventually came down to what would I do to him. He used to bribe me to stay over. I remember being told to count to 60 in Mississippi's until it would be over. I still can't bring myself to say that word without remembering those times. It went on for a while, I remember the last time though. Threatening to scream when his mum was downstairs, we were in his room and he'd locked the door. I told him I wanted to go but he didn't want me to. I started to yell as I snatched the key from his hand, I remember the key cutting my hand as I pulled it from his.\n\nI became very depressed growing up. Though I never got diagnosed or told anyone about it who might try and get me diagnosed, as I would have to tell them what happened. What if I told them and they told me that I had agreed to it? That it was consensual. Why should *I* be depressed when I had great parents who loved me and didn't beat me? Why would they take the whining and crying of some stupid fucking **disgusting, thieving whore** seriously when it could have been worse? And I was... I took money from him not to tell my parents, or to let him do other things to me. It was great though, I could buy toys my parents didn't have the money to buy for me. I didn't know what prostitution was. I didn't know how it would make me feel when I got older. That I'd carve those words, 'whore' 'thief' into my arm with broken glass or razor blades because there wasn't enough pain I could feel inside to let out all the hatred I felt for myself.\n\nSorry... talking about it, even anonymously is something I don't usually do and has led to a rambling monologue. I just wanted to try and get across how it felt for me. But to get back to the point. I didn't tell anyone because I didn't think it'd be taken seriously. I thought I'd be told that I had chosen to do it and for money no less. What I'm trying to say is, the \"You got laid dude, get over it\" or the \"It was sex that you wanted, you were just experimenting\" attitude was exactly what I feared. I was depressed from about the age of 14 and even now I'm not sure I'm entirely over it. I was emotionally insecure. I felt a need to have a girlfriend to prove to myself that I wasn't gay, that I hadn't wanted it. Until about the age of 18 I was fairly homophobic and even having a guy put his hand on me for more than a second made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Even after my first relationship ended I went into another spiral of depression and nearly killed myself. After my second relationship I was older and more confident. I'd get drunk at any opportunity and have sex with pretty much any girl I could, paid for sex several times, it didn't really help though. I still felt dirty and feeling that way made me feel more like a woman than a man. Men are suppose to feel awesome for having sex with lots of people right? Not like a slut. Part of me has always wished I was a woman. I'd considered it when I was younger, getting a sex change. If I was a woman then I'd be allowed to feel this way, it'd be normal. But I was always too worried about being viewed as abnormal, so never really made any attempt to go through with it. The thing is, through most of that I hid how I felt from almost everyone I knew and still do. People would think that I moved on quickly and got over it. But it is still a part of who I am.\n\nI always thought [this](http://i.imgur.com/zN3eG.jpg) was a good explanation regarding the ability to move on after something like sexual assault earlier in life.\n\nSorry for a wall of text. I guess the point I'm making is that men don't feel any differently to women (which I think is what you're saying anyway) but society trivialising the experience to men and acting like they're fine doesn't help and just makes men feel less manly for feeling the way they're told they're not meant to.",
    "rejected": "My earliest memories are of being sexually abused. I remember that I was at my dad’s house. I remember being naked. I remember hands reaching for me. I remember that I was in a lot of pain. I know that I was very, very young. \n\nWeirdly, I draw blanks about certain things. I don’t remember their faces. I don’t remember any words being said to me. It’s as if I know what happened now, but for a long time I didn't really know how to describe what happened. I couldn't put my finger on it. I have these pictures in my head-freeze frames of what happened. They are like still shots. \n\nLater on in childhood, maybe when I was 5 or 6, I was abused again. Some older kids(they were teenagers) in my neighborhood decided that one of the kids they bullied needed to prove he was “a real man”, as in, not gay, and they decided that the best way for him to do this was to sexually assault a girl. They *used me* to prove he was not gay. \n\nThe government got involved when I started telling stories about these incidents at my elementary school. I was taken away from my mother for a short time and ended up sleeping in a cot in a social worker’s office, next to her computer and office chair. I remember the social worker was kindhearted and really wanted to look out for me. She bought me clothes, toys, took me to restaurants, etc.\n\nShe was angry when she had to give me back to my mother. She drove to my mom’s house and brought a baggie of toys to give me as a present, but my mother was quite angry and defensive and she screamed at the social worker until she drove away from our home. \n\nThen, when I was 8, I met a teenage boy named Victor. Victor was and still is a friend of my older brother, David. Before Victor met me, he had already been in trouble with the police for sexually abusing two other children. He was only 15 and he had a criminal record. \nVictor groomed me. \n\nPedophiles who groom children buy them gifts, give them special treatment, etc. So, Victor intentionally made himself seem like a good friend to everyone in my family, and especially tried to be a good friend to me, so that nobody would suspect him of being a bad guy.   \nAfter he had gained my family’s trust, he did abuse me. \n\nHe waited until everyone had gone to sleep and he came into my bedroom. He showed me pornographic magazines, undressed me, he made me touch him, he touched me, etc. \n\nHe pressed his dick against my vagina and started trying to force his way inside me, while saying, \"I don't wanna hurt you, I'm not going to hurt you, don't worry, don't worry.\"\n\nI managed to get away from Victor a bit later by telling him that I was thirsty and needed a glass of water. He agreed to let me go if I promised that I wouldn't tell anyone. I did tell on him. \n\nSadly, nobody believed me. My mother said I was lying. I was told that I “wanted it” and that “I asked for it”. \n\nFor years, if I tried to bring the subject up, I was told to be quiet. Victor was allowed to visit our home for many years after that night. My older brother said that I was “a slut” who was trying to make Victor look bad. He told me that I should “get over it” and that Victor was a good guy. I was told on several occasions that I should feel sorry for Victor, because “it’s hard to be accused of that.” \n\nOnce, when I was at my brother’s house, he invited Victor over. I was supposed to be asleep in the guest room, but I just couldn't fall asleep. I heard the door open and I immediately knew who had just come over. My older brother then told Victor that he could check on me if he wanted to.\n\nVictor came into the room I was “sleeping” in and froze up. I pretended to be asleep because I was afraid. He leaned over me and breathed on me. Then he said, “She’s so beautiful”. I have never and will never hear anything as creepy and unsettling as, “she’s so beautiful” coming from the mouth of a sexual predator. \n\nI have PTSD. Night Terrors and flashbacks. Sometimes, when I have sex, I see the faces of the people who have abused me rather than the person I'm with. I was suicidal for a while because of this. \n\n**In what fucking universe does society tell rape victims to victimize themselves?** The one I live in tells you that it never happened. It tells you to shut up. It tells you that you're lying. It says that virtually everyone who doesn't fit into a small mold of what a \"good victim\" looks like is a lying whore or a guy who is a pussy. "

In six or seven years you'll be capable of making a more informed decision.\n\nHealthcare is screwed up? Well, thank Obama for that. Either way we have a good system, minus the Obamacare bullshit. If you have the money, you can get healthcare. I think that's a lot better than letting a board of doctors decide who gets taken care of and who doesn't. Not to mention waiting for fucking ever to get an appointment because everyone has healthcare and everyone is trying to get to the doctor for one thing or another. \n\nOur education system isn't the best. But you know what? It's not great everywhere else either. You get out of education what you put into it. If you want to learn more about something, if you want to educate yourself, the Internet is there. The library is there. Knowledge is all around you. If you rely solely on educational institutions for education, you're doing it wrong. K-12 schooling is not meant to teach you everything you need to know. It's there to give you the most basic general knowledge of things. And of course it's standardized. It has to be. Otherwise, you'd have one state with an amazing educational program and another state that is absolute shit. Standardization sucks, and it tends to dumb things down, but it's better than no standards at all.\n\nGreedy politicians are a fact of life and have been for as long as any form of human government has existed. The system of government that we now have is about as good as you can get with the composition of this country. That's something you can not change. Power corrupts people. Even the most kind-hearted people that go into politics become a little greedy. It's self-preservation. And don't even try to say 'if I was a politician...' because you have no idea, any more than I really do.\n\nAs far as American culture among youth - this goes back to you being 19. I was in your shoes when I was 19. I felt the same way. You know what I did? I joined the Air Force, got out of where I grew up, met a fuck-ton of people from all over the country, worked with other nations on aircraft, learned a bunch of about other cultures. I visited Europe and Canada. We're all just people, all around the world. We're all just humans. We're all just trying to do the best that we can with the light that we have. Youth will be youth and they will always be aggravating to most people. When you're young, you're concerned with social things - the way you look, act, talk. Your material possessions and social clout, your sense of humor and your network of friends. There is no difference between the youth of today and the youth of, say, the 80s. The only difference is in the methods of communication - instead of sitting on porches in the neighborhood and gossiping with each other face-to-face, youth are chatting it up online. What's wrong with that? Not a whole lot. Think of it this way - there is more writing and reading going on today then there ever has been in the entire history of the written word in the form of Facebook comments, twitter feeds, news articles, messageboards, and other online communication mediums. I think that's a great thing. Writing and reading are the prime form of communication between people in the developed world, it seems.\n\nWhat it all boils down to, man, is that you're too young to be making these kinds of decisions and worrying about this kind of shit. The economy sucks, sure - but it won't suck forever. These things move in cycles. Healthcare is bullshit right now but the whole system is in transition and there will be bumps along the way. American culture among youth - that problem, for you, will go away eventually. You'll get older and you'll stop paying attention and learn to tune it out. When you get done with college or get a job or whatever your situation is and you work with adults on a regular basis you'll figure that one out.\n\nDon't be so negative, look for positives, and stay optimistic. Work on affecting things that you can affect, like your local situation - your school, family, and town. Educate yourself. Don't turn into another drone that just parrots what people on TV and the radio and popular music say. Come up with your own ideas and opinions and views. I was like you once. I'm 26 now, with a wife and a kid. I'm about to get out of the Air Force. I'll be honest - I've met more atheist, progressive, think-outside-the-box types in the Air Force than I ever thought possible. It helped me mature and learn and become my own person. I never went to college, but I'm hoping that that experience can do the same for you. Good luck.\n\n",

Now then, with say two or three dots, can you tell that the picture will be a car? Of course not. The person supplying that data point could have just been extremely unlucky or extremely lucky. However, when you have say 500 dots, then you can clearly see that the picture will be a Ferrari.  This collection of anecdotes collectively is empirical data. you can perform statistical analysis on it to find am average trend. Rather than seeing just a point, you now have a view of the entire bell curve. If someone was unusually unlucky, you will be able to tell and know that in reality, it's a solid product. Likewise, if someone has been unusually lucky, you can also tell and know that you will most likely get a bad product.\n\n"

That's why \"it showed up on my news feed\" is the classic defence to that.\n\nIt's like the difference between reading a magazine that has pictures of someone and specifically seeking out all the magazines you can find with pictures of that person, cutting them all out, and putting them in a scrapbook. (I'll concede that one is much more effort than the other, but I think the analogy holds)\n\nIt shows that you have a level of interest in that person that is disconcerting – you want to find out lots of information about that person and follow their life without their involvement, consent or knowledge.",
    "rejected": "You can't use the the fact that something is allowable online as justification for expecting people not to act negatively toward a behavior.  Especially when said behavior makes them feel uncomfortable.  If a person or persons views being researched online as a violation of boundaries, you either need to respect it or establish that you do not respect their boundaries.  While they might not be able to stop you, they certainly don't need to like or accept the behavior in a social context.  One way displaying displeasure with such behavior is to refer to it as \"creeping\" and those doing it as being a \"creeper\".\n\nSo another way to word your question is:  \"Do people have a right to be upset that I learned things about them I found they posted online?\"  I say yes, why?  Because people have a right to their feelings, people establish social norms and boundaries and may be upset when someone violates it. \n\nFirst I much address:\n\n \"presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.\"\n\nYou presume to much, something posted on social media does not imply that the poster means for it be information observed, retained, and reported by every single person who could find access to it.  It might not be secret, but it is not meant to be a conversation piece either.\n\nIf I go to a coffee shop and have a personal conversation with a friend about my Mother dying of cancer, it's not a secret conversation and people may over hear.  However if someone, even an acquaintance, comes up to me a month later and starts a conversation with \"I heard you talking about your dying Mom at Starbucks last April.\"  I'm going to find it off putting, and likely consider that person a creep.  \n\nThe online world seems to become a place where people tell themselves that if a door is unlocked they are allowed inside.  If someone leaves a photo album open, they are allowed to open the book make copies of all the pictures and maybe using them in Photoshop later.  While legally, they are right with the second example, social norms in groups may have different rules.  These rules can change from group to group and you don't have to agree to them to be held to them in the eyes of the group.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that people not only take issue with the action of being researched, they also take issue with and are made uncomfortable with  idea of someone taking the time and effort to research them and see what is available about them online.  They may not be able to stop said activity, but they certaintly don't need to treat it as an acceptable for of social interaction."

    "chosen": "&gt; 1: Handwriting is becoming more and more irrelevant by the minute\n\nAre we ever going to get to the point where its easier and faster to turn on a device, start a word processor, and then type the message then it is to just write it quickly on a piece of paper? If we do, something tells me it wont be for quite a while.\n\n&gt; 2: Children do not enjoy handwriting in the slightest!\n\nThere are many things you do not enjoy in life that still need to be done. School is about preparing children for the future, not making them happy.\n\n&gt; 3: Children are better at typing\n\nWhich means we don't have to focus on that as much. \n\n&gt; 4: Children LOVE computers in learning\n\nThat's cool but somewhat irrelevant.\n\n&gt; 5: Children actually enjoy typing\n\nWhich again is cool, but putting a computer in every kids hand is something that is simply not able to be done across the board. Most schools simply do not have the funding to do this and the software for ones that do is painfully underdeveloped. \n\n&gt; 6: It is possible to get marked incorrectly in a test just because they have bad handwriting\n\nYou also now can't even turn in an assignment if you have technical difficulties. Both sides have their drawbacks. \n\n&gt; 7: Schools tend to have a tight budget, and i feel like teaching something that will be more relevant when the child is older would be more beneficial (like programming)\n\nThis goes back to my point that even implementing a scenario where kids don't need to physically write is far too expensive to do. Schools are already strapped for cash. Where the hell are they getting the money to bring in that many computers and rework their entire curriculum?",
    "rejected": "I know this is old, but here it goes:\n\n&gt;Handwriting is becoming more and more irrelevant by the minute\n\nI disagree. I actually think that handwriting is more important than it was a few years ago. Whereas a couple of years ago most portable electronic devices had keyboards, now most have touchscreens that you can write on. I see way more people writing on their tablets than typing.\n\nI also don't think it's becoming irrelevant in general. It's far easier just to jot something down on a piece of paper or a notepad than to type it into a phone. I have to type in my passcode, open the notes program and type something in with the tiny on-screen keyboard. Not to mention how simple notes are in this form: you're basically restricted to lines of text. On paper (or in a note-taking program working on a touchscreen iPad-style tablet or from a Wacom-style tablet for your PC) you can circle things; write in multiple colours; draw tables, diagrams and graphs; make notes in the margins, etc. How much longer would it take to do [this](http://x111.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/University_notes.jpg) on your laptop, especially with those horrible touchpads.\n\n**Personally**, I find it much, much faster to write by hand. I am an excellent typist, but that's not really the issue. Firstly, it's not often that I'll be typing non-stop. Instead I will nearly always need to stop and think about what to write next. I'm sure that if I was typing non-stop (if I was, for example, recording dictated speech) I would be MUCH faster than if I was writing, but I don't do that. \n\nI write when I need to make quick notes, and when I'm taking university notes. When I'm taking university notes, as I said before, I need to make diagrams, tables, graphs, etc. I need to \"format\" the next by highlighting, circling and underlining things. Despite knowing all the necessary shortcuts in Libreoffice Writer, it's still *much* faster to do this by hand, and the result is usually much easier to read. I find I have better retention when I handwrite than when I type as well.\n\nGenerally, the only reports I type up are mathematics assignments, where I'm not having to record information at the same rate it's presented to me, so I can feel free to take my time to use LaTeX to make it all look amazing. But I still write it all by hand first.\n\n&gt;Children do not enjoy handwriting in the slightest!  \n&gt;Children actually enjoy typing\n\nMost children don't enjoy school in general, and I suspect children enjoy typing only because it's a chance to \"play on the computer\" and it's generally turned into some kind of computer game. Maybe that would be an effective strategy to apply to handwriting as well.\n\nIn order words, kids don't get access to computers much, so when they do get a chance it's usually pretty exciting. If they were exposed to computers more, I'm sure it'd just become yet another thing to do at school.\n\n&gt;Children LOVE computers in learning\n\nSee above. I'm not sure children love computers in learning as much as they love something new and exciting in learning. I had a computer at home, so I didn't find using the heavily restricted school ones that interesting. The kids that didn't have the internet or even a computer at all were far more excited to use them at school. Kids seemed less excited about computers as they were more heavily introduced, as well.\n\n&gt;It is possible to get marked incorrectly in a test just because they have bad handwriting\n\nIt's possible to get marked incorrectly in a test just because they've misspelt words as well, but that doesn't necessarily mean we shouldn't teach spelling. I'm just not sure this is a strong point. If someone has written so illegibly that it's not possible to actually read their answers then it's not unreasonable to get marked wrong. Part of being able to complete examinations is being able to write clearly and neatly. That's what you'll have to do in all examinations from now until forever. As long as we have tests, they'll be written IMO - computers aren't secure enough.\n\n*EDIT: I should add that if a child is physically unable to write neatly - e.g. they have a disability of some kind - then it is nearly always possible for them to get a writer in serious examinations. Probably not in primary school, but primary school tests are mostly irrelevant.*\n\n&gt;Schools tend to have a tight budget, and i feel like teaching something that will be more relevant when the child is older would be more beneficial (like programming)\n\nDespite being a programmer, computer science major and big-time computer nerd, I don't think we need to teach every child programming. Should we educate primary school kids on how to use technology? Yes. Should we educate kids in secondary school in programming? Yeah, sure. Does that conflict with teaching handwriting? No, of course not. Programming is something you might start teaching at the beginning on high school. Handwriting is something you almost certainly will finish teaching in primary school - there's simply no need to teach it above that age group.\n\nAlso, if budgets are tight, it's going to be a lot easier to teach kids something they can learn with a pad of paper and pencil - and which has everyday use - than something they require thousands of dollars worth of equipment and tens of thousands of dollars worth of IT-guy salaries to use, and which 95% of kids won't use again.\n\nI'm not suggesting you shouldn't teach programming, I just don't think it's relevant in primary school, nor do I think it's valuable to teach everyone programming. Just those that are interested in it. I don't think handwriting is relevant in high school either, so I don't see a conflict. I think handwriting is far more relevant than programming for 95% of people."

They hid their brush strokes, tried to create something close to a photograph.  This is loosely called \"realism.\"\n\n* Then a stylistic change happened.  Painters started painting *representations* of objects. Maybe they were not super realistic, maybe you could see the brush strokes. Maybe they were just painting the light that an object gave off.  This was different than realism, but they were still focused on painting *things.*  This was called impressionism.\n\n* Then the guy I linked came along and decided, fuck painting *things,* I'm going to paint a *painting.* Just a painting. It doesn't have to represent or look like an object, it can just be paint on canvas. This was considered radical, and launched several other branches of art.\n\nIt sounds silly now, and if some dude came along painting black squares we wouldn't give two shits.

It's difficult to walk on the local college campus without being dragged into some conversation or other. That's actually a problem, normally when you're walking you are *going somewhere* and *need to be there at a specific time*. Getting drawn into a conversation that requires significant time to come to a bigger realization and a better understanding of the world isn't necessarily the best idea in those situations. After all, you have to choose between meeting your engagements (getting to class/work/parties on time) or having a chat. The same sort of thing can happen (but happens less often) on Kennesaw Main Street or the Marietta Square. As someone who has been there, chatting with people in public can become very expensive rather quickly in terms of time and effort. Is it worth the benefits for the costs in time and effort? That's a the kind of thing where each person has a different answer. It's worth it for some folks and not worth it to others.\n\nLast year I was up in Connecticut to see my sister, and I'm used to small talk on the street and such.

However, other medical illnesses aren't treated this way; if you go to the doctor for a routine check-up and your cholesterol is high, the doctor will attempt to intervene and the patient is expected to take the doctor's advice. \n\nSeeking help for medical illnesses is also voluntary.  Nobody is required to go to a doctor for a medical condition. \nCholesterol screening is not mandatory.   A doctor will suggest having it checked and you can accept or decline. \n\nCholesterol screening is a simple blood diagnostic.  It's taken with other information such as age, health status, and symptoms to decide if the patient should try to lower cholesterol to lower their risk of cardiovascular problems.   \n\nDiagnosing depression isn't a diagnosis not a test.   Depression isn't a fixed mental state. Symptoms may come and go with stress or change in situation. To make an accurate assessment the patient needs to be seen by a mental health provider not the family doctor and a complete history needs to be taken.\n\nUsually when they talk about \"screening\"  it means the patient fills out a short 10 or 20 question survey,  points are added up for each answer, and a score suggests if the patient might need further follow up.   It relies on the patient giving honest answers and being self aware of their feelings. But as you know people who are seriously mentally ill may not be the best judge of themselves.\n\nThe thing is that the patient STILL must see a mental health professional to get a proper diagnosis.   If they're not ready to accept the possibility,  they're not going to do.  I don't believe the family doctor should try to play psychiatrist and try assorted psych meds; he doesn't have the training and the patient isn't getting therapist support.\n\nA better solution is to teach people the value of mental health services.   Get then them to trust mental health providers.   Make mental health care more accessible and more affordable.

You are by no means guaranteed for this to ever happen to you.  But whatever slim odds you have, they are only going to go down if you force yourself to act like someone else that you don't like.  Or if you build up a relationship on mind games and theatrics just for the sake of getting the hookup to happen, without regard for what comes afterwards.\n\nAnother point - people in college still have maturing to do.  The women you met in college aren't perfect, any more than you are.

Someone who felt genuine, someone that I not only wanted to be with, but I could trust that they actually had just as much interest in me.\n\nIf someone sleeps with you only because you act cold and she wants the attention and validation, she has problems.  Find yourself someone with less problems if you still want that to chase that \"loves you as a person\" ideal.

Not wanting to overly commit before i even know the person I am committing to on a truly deep level (plus the fact that we are only just shaping our lives and changing ourselves) doesn't make me an anti intellectual party slut, it makes me just a little more realistic than you.\n\n\nThe problem with guys like this is that they develop expectations of emotions before the person. They don't compliment me by being ready to get serious, they just want to get serious and I fit the mold. They are often very superfeicial, see that you are smart and pretty and already they are deeply in love - yeah, right. \n\nSometimes, I can flirt with guys i see no future with and want none, exactly because of that. They are safe, I won't disappoint them. I don't have to care about their feelings. \n\nBut there are guys who are just like me, and who are nice. They are nice, but they aren't trying to force closeness or a relationship, they need to get to know me first. We can be relaxed around each other. Those are usually the ones that get the most, not the alphas or the \"nice\" guys. Just guys you can identify with. Who go in without great promises or expectations, and create them based on you and what you have together. We know that if something happenes and we have to end it in few months or years, no one will say \"what a waste it was\" but we will look back at our time together as something really great for what it was, not for the preconcieved expectation it failed to fulfil. \n\nAnd being overly curteous - that is nice, but that is nice in such a cold, formal way. It is a formality and when you want to bond with someone you want closeness. Sincerity. Identification. Gestures are just gestures. Of course you should be nice to the girl, and she should be nice to you, but there is no need for flowers and ceremonial behavior. Be nice in a personal way when you get to know her. Small thing every now and then when you get really inspired. Why appreciate the behavior you do so mechanically because you think you should? \n\nA guy and a girl can make out together on a park bench and drink cheap beer and burp around each other and still be the sweetest people to one another and have the best date ever. \n\nYour problem isn't that girls want some alpha type, it is that your idea of niceness is too impersonal, too formal and lacks some true substance. It's ok you're 19. There is a lot to learn about relationships and connecting to people. I suggest stop focusing on finding someone to spend your life with and start focusing on the actual person in front of you and what you have in the moment. Enjoy those moments and learn about people, you don't need to fit it all into some grand plan and girls are no special creatures who are disrespected unless you're ready to marry them right away. "

    "chosen": "&gt;if teenage girls do not have the ability to trust their parents, then they do not have the ability to trust their own decisions.\n\nI really envy your relationship with your parents. I'm a teenage guy, and I cannot put my trust in my parents. They have conflicting views on how they raise me, so I have to make the decision for myself. For example, my mom believes that I should never compromise my beliefs and I should always make a stand for what I believe is right. My dad however, says there are times when it's okay to reason with people and to compromise if it could avoid unnecessary conflict. Lengthy story there just to say, many teenagers cannot put complete trust in what their parents say. Parents are just bigger kids raising kids. It's unfortunate, but sometimes teenagers have to trust in their own ability They have to make choices for themselves. Parents should be there to help their child if they fall down in their pursuit to find what's right for them in life.\n\nNow to argue the point, in America, there are many religious people that think it's wrong for their children to have sex. So they'll cut off education, and access to contraceptives as well as organizations such as Planned Parenthood. If they needed to have parental consent, it would stop *some* teenagers, but for the ones it wouldn't stop, std's and pregnancies would increase. Plus it would cause a lot of family tension because of what they did. In rare cases, disowning and sometimes beating.\n\nThe solution isn't to take away the option of getting birth control, (which, for a LOT of teenagers you would be doing that for,) but rather to educate the people using them properly. I was never given the talk so I had to do a lot of research about it through school and online. (Funny story, I learned about masturbation from a YouTube Poop video) If they could teach what I learned through the sources given to me (not YouTube poop) teenagers would be smarter when making the decision to have sex.\n\nSide note, have some confidence in what you're saying. You're opinion is just as valid as any other non professional persons.\n\n",

I would consider myself more independent compared to other teenage girls, however I believe that research is required before making decisions such as birth control.\n\nThis is good for you, but not all people have such good relationships with their parents, and having a bad relationship with your parents doesn't mean you are incapable of making your own decisions. You seem to imply this here:\n\n&gt;I believe that teenage girls are first of all not mature enough to have a well researched, or experience say in their sex lives. Their parents have gone through decisions like these, and if teenage girls do not have the ability to trust their parents, then they do not have the ability to trust their own decisions.\n\nNot everyone has great parents and, as I said before, your relationship with your parents says nothing about your quality and maturity as a person. And teenagers aren't totally incompetent. \n\n&gt;Another point is that I believe if teens were given the ability to take birth control without the consent of their parents, they would be increasingly prone to chances of obtaining sexually transmitted diseases. To prevent this, teenagers should talk to their parents about possible health risks involved with taking birth control pills.\n\nBirth control doesn't make you more prone or susceptible to STIs. STIs are not a health risk of birth control pills.\n\nKids are going to have sex, and we can't stop that, the only thing we can do is make it safe. There comes a certain time when a teenager has the agency to, together with their doctor, make their own decisions without the consent of the parents, who may have other motives."

    "prompt": "I believe God is a completely illogical concept with no basis in reality and was created solely to help us cope with our mortality.",
    "chosen": "As with all logic, the existence or non-existence of God hangs on some assumptions.  Here are mine:\n\n1. The universe exists.\n2. The universe has physical limits.\n3. The second Law of Thermodynamics (2nd Law) can be taken as true until a single counterexample can be found.\n4. The rule of cause-and-effect applies outside the Universe as well as in.  That is to say, effects still require cause, even if the 2nd Law doesn't apply somewhere outside the universe.\n\nAssuming the universe exists, it must have either (1) existed forever, (2) had a beginning.  If the universe has existed forever, it is infinitely old, but is not infinite in its material content, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics implies that the universe would have achieved a perfectly stable maximum state of entropy (in other words, has all worn down to complete homogeneity).\n\nAs an aside, some consider the possibility of a cyclical universe that has periodic big bangs, then collapses in on itself and repeats.  This would necessarily require a violation of the 2nd law of Thermodynamics (though admittedly the conditions of pre-big-bang universe have not been replicated in the lab).  Furthermore, they don't line up with a universe that is accelerating outward.  So that theory contradicts observable scientific evidence.\n\nI can observe that the universe has not achieved maximum entropy, and conclude that it must have a beginning.  This \"beginning\" is an effect that logically requires a Cause.  I'm going to define that Cause as God for the sake of this argument.\n\nThe inevitable follow-up question here asks, \"then what made God?\"  If the cause is not eternal, and itself had a cause, then one must trace that back to whatever the prime cause was.  Or some infinite cycle of causes, or some other weirdness.   Anyway, I'm defining God as either the prime, eternal cause or the latest in the infinite series of causes.  In either case, God the Cause necessarily violates some rules (2nd law, etc) of our universe and is not bound by them.  God is necessarily outside the universe.\n\nMy 4th assumption is that cause-and-effect must still apply outside the universe, as we are discussing the logic-worthiness of God's existence, and to throw it out at this point would be self-defeating.  So God is directly or indirectly eternal, and created/caused the Universe.\n\nThe God of the Universe is either personal or impersonal.  An example of an impersonal God is the idea that the big bang was caused by the collision of multiple universes.  As stated before, at least some of those other universes must not be bound by our universe's rules.  Yet if such a universe caused ours, why then does our 2nd law have no exception?  Until the counterexample is found, I consider it reasonable to conclude that such an impersonal cause is an unlikely scenario.  And any competing theory involving an impersonal God must likewise address this criticism.\n\nIt is most likely, then, that the God is personal, to be able to create a universe with a substance different than Himself.  To apply creativity and distinctiveness to a universe containing, as it does, the 2nd law, without Himself being bound by it.\n\nIf God is personal, then He either has a plan for humanity or does not.  If he has no plan, then any action we take concerning religion or the afterlife is moot.  That's an intellectual possibility, but since neither science nor religion has anything to say about such a god, it warrants no further discussion.\n\nIf however God has a plan for humanity, then He has either revealed it, or has not.  Again, if the plan is unrevealed, then we're just meaninglessly taking our chances by any action we take.  But if the plan has been revealed (and I'm going to assume it's not some cosmic gotcha, because that discussion is way too technical), then one of the existing religions must have in the past or must currently contain the proper way to adhere to that plan.\n\nI'll leave it at the door of comparative religion.\n\n*TL;DR* I have demonstrated not only that, logically speaking, the concept of God's existence is not only possible, but likely.  I further elaborated on a reasonable picture of the nature of God.  I welcome your criticisms and counterarguments.",

    "prompt": "Democracy cannot be sustained, and will soon fail.",
    "chosen": "I wrote an essay on this topic last week in my political science class. Received a 98 on it. Your concerns are the exact same concerns the framers had when they wrote the constitution. The short answer is that through the Madisonian model, we are already mostly ruled by the elites. The long answer is below:\n\n\"As the framers constructed the new Constitution in Philadelphia, the fear of a tyrannical majority and wariness about the stability of direct democracy resulted in the search for a distribution of political power that balanced democracy with elitism. The end result was a new federal government composed of institutional mechanisms that allowed a spirit of direct democracy, but not the same exact composition, satisfying the interests of the elites for stability and the interests of the lower classes for a voice of representation. \n\nThe framers were not inherently against state rights. Their fear of the tyrannical majority was a rational reaction to the convoluted state politics of the 1780s. As the newly liberated state legislatures celebrated their freedom after the Revolutionary War, officials elected to the state legislatures often came from lower class background and possessed relatively little education. Secondly, these legislators served only one-year terms and so there was little compelling reason for them to learn the intricacies of government or to design new public policies that solved long-term problems. Thus, these legislators frequently enacted shortsighted and unjust laws that only benefited their local constituents. For example, many state paper money acts were passed that while benefitting local constituents in the short term, hurt creditor groups and the broader state economies in the long term. As time passed, it became clear to the nation’s leaders that these state legislators were merely spokesmen for their constituents and either not interested or not aware of the interests and needs of their state as a whole. In response to this unsettling development, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “173 Despots [is] as oppressive as one. An elected despotism was not the government we fought for.” \n\nThis mismanagement of the state economies by the self-interested legislatures caused the economic depression that had started after the Revolutionary War to intensify, sending much of the lower class into bankruptcy. In Massachusetts, bankrupt farmers demanded the suspension of debtor prosecution when they were not able to pay back the merchants in gold. When their demands were ignored, Daniel Shays, a former captain in the Continental army, led one thousand farmers to the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Shays’ Rebellion was the final proof to the framers that the greatest threat to the stability of the new nation was not a tyrannical executive from the elite, but a tyrannical, lower class majority. \n\nIn the 1780s, there was only one known type of democracy: simple, direct, by-the-people, for-the-people democracy. However, it was this type of democracy, where the laws and future of a nation are determined by the simple majority, that had resulted in such ineffective governance in the state legislatures. If the framers constructed a national government based on this same direct democracy, they feared that in time the popular class would enact laws that benefited themselves but not the elites. Additionally, the framers worried that the instability of direct democracy would eventually ruin the nation. James Madison noted the “turbulent democracies in ancient Greece and modern Italy” and pinpointed the source of their instability to be factions. Then noting that since factions are an inevitable consequence of liberty, and since liberty is a requirement of democracy, Madison argued that direct democracies are inherently instable. Thus while the framers sincerely wanted a democratic form of government, direct democracy posed too great a risk to their elite class and to the stability of the nation as a whole. \n\nTo create a democratic government that did not result in tyranny or instability, institutional mechanisms needed to be created that had the spirit of direct democracy but not the same exact composition. In Federalist Paper #10, James Madison wrote, “To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction and at the same time preserve the spirit and form of popular government is then the great object to which are inquiries are directed.”  The Framer’s goal was to form a government that had the tools to appease and control the factions, thereby protecting the long-term interests of the nation and the elites.  \n\nIn Federalist Paper #51, James Madison presented his answer to this quandary: “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions”. The auxiliary precautions that Madison identified as so crucial to enabling the government to control itself are today known as Separation of Powers, Checks and Balances, and Federalism. These political elements, now cumulatively known as the Madisonian Model, would become the defining characteristics of the new federal government and their interlocking strength would protect it from the attacks of tyranny and factions till the present day. Through the strict separation of powers within the federal government and between the federal and state governments, a more limited form of democracy was born. Thus, the Madisonian Model was the key to combining the interests of the elites with democracy in a distribution of political power agreeable to all. \n\nThe first element of the Madisonian Model is the separation of the legislative, judicial and executive powers into separate branches. This separation of powers prevents the political ideology of a temporary majority from quickly infiltrating the entire federal government. The legislature is divided into the house of representative and the senate, which was originally elected by the house, but today is also elected by the people. The house serves terms of two years while the senate serves six-year terms. This difference in term limits gives the Senate a more distant perspective on politics and government, allowing them to propose laws that benefit the long-term future of the nation while ignoring temporarily angered constituents. The executive branch contains the president who is elected for one to two four-year terms. The judicial branch contains the nine judges of the Supreme Court who are appointed by the president for life terms. Together these three branches of political power operate in a system of checks and balances, to ensure the federal government produces stable and smooth governance, no matter the size or power of majority factions. \n\nThe Checks and Balance system is the second element of the Madisonian Model and it defines the relationships and the rules of behavior between the three separate branches of the federal government. These checks and balances further weaken the influence of temporary majority factions on the federal government by giving a branch the power to negate decisions or change the salaries and budgets of another branch that may have become too inclined to an ideology. For example, the legislative branch has the power to confirm and set the salaries and budgets of all federal judges, pass legislation, set the federal budget and impeach a president. The judicial branch has the power to declare executive orders and legislative laws unconstitutional. The executive branch has the power to nominate federal judges and veto legislation. In addition, the powerful process of amending the constitution requires the intricate cooperation of all three branches. Madison called this system of checks and balances the best defense against “agrarian attempts” to overthrow the government, because without these checks and balances, the separate branches would surely be overtaken by factions that refused to cooperate with the other branches of government.\n\nThe third element of the Madisonian Model is Federalism, which is where both the federal government and state governments exist at the same time in the same place, exerting their own unique sovereign power. With Federalism, the federal government controls foreign policy, regulates interstate commerce and promotes uniform standards of trade, while the sovereignty of the states is preserved in all areas not specifically relegated to the authority of the federal government. Federalism is advantageous for the lower classes and majority factions because it gives more autonomy to the states and more chances for political participation by citizens. For example, when African-Americans were repeatedly denied their civil rights by southern courts and juries, the civil rights movement was able to successfully restate their appeals for justice in the federal courts. Federalism’s drawback however, was that it increased government duplication and complexity, creating an environment prone to legal disputes. Nonetheless, Federalism is also advantageous and vital to the elites because it allows the lower class factions to shape state governments to reflect their own colorful or temporary interests, allowing the federal government and the elite’s interests to remain relatively insulated. \n\nThus through the Madisonian Model, the framers were able to create a new type of democratic government that balanced the interests of the elites with the interests of the lower classes. The Madisonian model’s ingenious ability to let the elites maintain control while still providing a legitimate voice to the lower classes has led to it serving as a model for democratic governments around the world for over 200 years. Thus since their incorporation into a single political element in 1787, the three concepts of Separation of Powers, Checks and Balances, and Federalism have changed our world immeasurably. \"\n\n",

For example, the ratio of changed minds is probably higher on here than the rest of Reddit: people here are more likely to be open-minded: just look at how many deltas are transacted.\n\nAlthough the Dunning-Kruger effect is real, it has opposite effects as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\n\nIn fact, many of my friends in doctoral programs face the opposite of Dunning-Kruger; since they are intellectual, they are much more aware of all the things they don't know: they're aware that the knowledge space is far bigger than someone who doesn't know anything at all and thinks the knowledge space is small because they only have a small glimpse of it. They are less obnoxious about their opinions, and spend much less time looking for social validation because they're too busy *doing* and *learning*.\n\nA democratic political system may seem intimidating for an intellectual faced with majority rule, but in reality, people with intellect tend to be far more able to leverage their power than people who are not intellectual. In *general* (not in every case by any means), intellectual people have more political/social capacity than others. \n\n*In general* you have to meet some threshold of intellect and *demonstrate* that intellect to be a Supreme Court justice, or a President, or a CEO/COO/CTO/CFO, or a professor in academia, or a Pulitzer winner. And these are the people with the means and support to change people's minds. And you don't even need to be one of these people to enact some form of change. Though it may seem like the *odds* are against you, being intellectual is a better indicator of capacity and gives a better chance than *not* being intellectual.\n\nHopefully this helps change your view."

    "chosen": "&gt;I think the best analogies for my case is the fat guy that keeps going to the gym, but can't drop a pound, because he always \"rewards himself with a burger / fries / cake\" \n\nWeight is controlled by many variables.   You can't look at a fat guy and know why he's fat.  So this analogy doesn't work.\n\n&gt; you provide a safety net or some other type of welfare program, so now the \"poor folk\" save 100$ or 200$ or however much the program saves them, but instead of using that money to better their lives on the long-term, they dump them in a new expensive bag, shoes, first-class tickets to a match or what-have-you. \n\nIf you really think poor people on welfare are living the life of luxury, you've never seen the projects.    You're making a lot of assumptions. \n\n&gt;My point is that creating massive welfare programs isn't going to stop poverty, no amount of government interference would ever erase poverty. In fact, there'll always be a large group (dare I say majority) of \"working class\" who are stuck in their position not because of the lack of hard work or talent, but because they have absolutely no self-control when it comes to spending.\n\nSpending is half the equation.   But if a person would only be able to earn $15k a year, financial classes won't change that they will always be in a deficit.   There is a minimum amount of money a person must earn to afford food,  clothes, shelter, medical care, and other absolute essentials.    Doesn't matter how many classes a person takes, they still need those essentials.\n\nYou need to consider why a person is in poverty.  It could be mental illness.   It could be physical disability.  Could be that they live in a part of the country where unemployment is significant.  \n\nWomen with kids tend to be a group likely to end up in poverty.   Did you know childcare [costs more than college]( http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/04/news/economy/child-care-costs-college/)?  \n\nMedical bills are a top reason why an ordinary person [can end up in bankruptcy]( http://www.cnbc.com/id/100840148).   Now they have bad credit and probably reduced ability to work.  \n \nLecturing them to clip coupons or buy things on sale won't fix these problems.   \n\nAnd the one big problem I have with how America does social programs is that there's this big gap between poverty level living with benefits and a living wage.   raises and promotions happen incrementally.   A person who keeps working full time and gets one or two little raises lose their benefits.  Their quality of life drops significantly when they lose medical coverage.  If the average family insurance plan [costs $22k]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2013/05/22/annual-healthcare-costs-surpasses-22000/) and employees are still paying less than $10.00/hour, what do they do?  Do you work full time and lose heath coverage for your family knowing you can't afford to buy it out right?   Or do you work a little less, get health needs met (medicaid), and also get food and childcare subsidized?     \n\nBeing poor isn't fun.   Instead of seeing them as lacking self control or being dumb, I propose we address the social and economic reasons why people end up earning so little they can't afford essentials and are eligible for welfare.

The best way to get out of poverty is to get a job, right? But how does one go about getting a job when there are no customers to support employers? \n\nThere is no economic argument to be made here because people with no money are excluded from the economy.

    "chosen": "You're basically asking humans (read, not men or women, but both) to just control some very powerful urges as though it's as easy as flipping a light switch. I think you know that's not possible. \n\nThe problem with the arguments on this is that they tend to vilify men. We're (men) the bad guy, despite the fact that both the man and the woman chose to have unprotected sex *together.* We could easily sit here and reverse your expectation to women being the ones who should be expected to not engage in sex with a man they don't want to have a child with. \n\nSo, basically, your argument is one-side, and likely biased. \n\nA better solution would be promotion of proper sex education. Now, when I throw the word proper in there, I mean that the subject is taught with all the biology, mechanics and consequences we're all familiar with, but instead with more emphasis on personal responsibility and handling those consequences should they arise. In short, having a better educated general public is the key. \n\nHowever, going back to your desire to place the responsibility solely on the male, do you think that is fair? Because I don't. What you're really saying here is that the guy has no right to object and his desire to not have a child doesn't matter. \n\nWhat about in the event where you have a women who claims to be on birth control and insists that a condom is not necessary, but turns out to be lying? Because if you don't think that happens, I can tell you it does. \n\nSo, there is where I think that rather than placing the expectation solely on the guy, *both* sexes needed to be better educated. We could just as easily say women should be expected to not have sex with a guy they don't want to risk having a child with. Would it change anything? No, not at all, because it's irrational. If instead we stopped trying to place blame on one or the other sex and focus on teaching, advocating and displaying personal responsibility *to both sexes* in all matters sexual, then we would see a dramatic improvement over time.

Men can't force women to get an abortion or put the child up for adoption because it's not their body. Women have a lot more authority on the situation thanks to nature, and men get screwed over financially because of it (in many cases). That said, sex at risk of pregnancy does have equality. People argue that abstinence is the only perfect defense against pregnancy, and birth control is restricted in many situations, but birth control does it exist. That option is still there for so many people. Birth control applies to both genders. If you can mutually choose to have sex without the intention of procreating, then a man should not be forced to pay child support for an unwanted child any more than a woman should be forced to give birth to that child. \n\nYes, in the grand scheme of things, if a man doesn't want the risk of having a child to be an issue, he shouldn't have sex. Nor should a woman. But as we as humans have discovered, sex doesn't have to be exclusive to procreation, and neither men nor women should be trapped in situations that were not planned on based on consequences that could have been remedied before the real problems occur, like paying financial support or keeping and raising a child when abortion and adoption are completely reasonable."

The history of an oppressor using their position of power to oppress on the basis of a small characteristic is what makes racism racism.\n\nif this history wasn't involved, and people simply used race as a way to describe people (even if poorly), no one would care about racism.

One of the first professional areas that the brand-new German-style universities focused on were business: six of the biggest business schools were founded in this era. Treating administration, management, and entrepreneurship as scientific problems you could study, understand and teach were part of the broader approach to institutionalizing research.\n\n&gt; Moreover, business school doesn't develop critical thinking skills found in other disciplines, but rather cultivates a sense that the world exists of cutthroats and social Darwinism.\n\nEh, I don't see the case studies they do in MBA programs as any more suspicious than the ones JD or MD students look at. Meanwhile, the actual research done by professors at business schools is in many cases extremely good. I don't think you can make a principled objection to either the students or the professors.\n\n&gt; I feel as though most people who go to college to \"study\" business are really just in it for the money - there is absolutely no passion about their studies to be found within. \n\nWell, there are lots of passionless students everywhere in universities. It's a general problem. At least people who think their studies will make them rich, and are also very greedy, are *motivated*. Greed is a passion, after all. \n\nAs for business course for undergraduates - I agree, that's like vocational school.

    "chosen": "So what you're saying is that, because we preserve things with economic value, we should create uses for things without economic value so that we have a vested interest in preserving them.\n\nI see four problems with this. Firstly, just because we have supply does not mean we will also have demand. If McDonalds makes McBengal patties, that doesn't mean they'll sell any. The patties have to taste good, too, and if we're not already eating tigers, there's probably a reason for that. Making a use for something endangered and then expecting people to come buy it just because it exists is putting the cart before the horse. (Also, Bengal Tigers are apex predators, so we can't eat them. But that's beside the point.)\n\nSecondly, there are lots of factors involved with endangerment of species. Look at how much trouble we're having trying to get pandas to breed in captivity, or resurrecting Galapagos turtles. It takes a lot of time, energy, and institutional will to save a species, and for all the free market's virtues, patience isn't one of them. \n\nThirdly, when we 'preserve' something in this way, we change it - often fundamentally. Nobody is going to mistake a \"managed timberland\" for an old-growth forest. Sure, if we're getting all our wood from the timberland that means we aren't cutting down forests right and left. But that timberland takes up space, and it makes perfect economic sense to put it right on top of the forest you're so keen on preserving. I mean, you're cutting down trees both ways, right? And to pick on your last example, cows are a species we created. Do you see any [Aurochs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs) running around these days?\n\nAnd fourthly, there already is a supply of Bengal tigers. It's called poaching. Tiger skins and internal organs are big business on the black market. And the WWF [addresses your suggestion directly](http://www.savetigersnow.org/problem) on their website - China has tiger farms already, and the result has only been to increase the amount of illegal poaching that goes on.

    "prompt": "Life is meaningless and we should all commit suicide",
    "chosen": "The presence of present suffering does not equal future suffering.\n\n**Be happy.** The complicated part is how to achieve this.\nThe first thing one must do, is to figure out why they are here. In the grand scheme of things, what does their life mean? One needs to find some type of spirituality. For those who believe in a deity it may not be as difficult, but for those who do not, a void is often left. The first place to start for an atheist is to recognize the sheer improbability of one’s own consciousness. The fact that billions of years ago energy condensed into matter, this matter consolidated to form giant space rocks, these rocks flew past each other altering each other’s trajectory through space, one just happened to settle next to an appropriate size star and at the appropriate distance, amino acids on this rock came together in the perfect conditions, created life, life evolved, and you became you.\n\nNot only is it amazing that you are here. The fact that you know you are here is amazing. I think therefore I am. (I refine Descartes’ statement as, “I am aware, therefore I am.”) Knowing how all this happened, and realizing the time scale, one can start to appreciate the gift of the short time of consciousness we are all given by the cosmos. We only have a short time in existence so it is important to attain this happiness while we are here, this appreciation of our consciousness is the first step.\nMany people subconsciously know they want happiness, but are confused as to how to get there. I find it unsettling when I hear people worry about growing up to be a janitor or some other career that is unjustly looked down upon by society. Don’t get me wrong, a person needs money to be happy, but the only reason they need it is to fulfill Maslow’s basic needs. All other acquirements are superfluous. What people don’t study enough is what creates happiness, they only study what creates money.\n\nWhat we must realize is that we are the human animal. When is a dog at its happiest? Is it happy when it is in a cage, cooped up, with no stimulation? Or is it happiest when it is running around, playing fetch? A dog is happiest when it is being a dog and doing dog things. The same goes for humans. Humans are happiest when they are actualizing their human nature. When we notice the presence of mirror neurons, and the negative feelings that arise in ourselves when we hurt someone, and notice the positive feelings that arise when we help someone, we can start to understand our true nature. Often when people come home from war, after having killed, after destroying other consciousness’s, they become suicidal or depressed. Conversely, new mothers and fathers often describe the day their child was born, the day they created consciousness, as “the happiest day of my life.” These are actions humans take that are at two ends of a spectrum, with many other actions that affect other people in between. Insulting someone and complimenting someone are also two opposite actions on this spectrum. When I ask myself why I want to have children I cannot come up with an obvious rational answer, but when I notice that procreating is ingrained in the human species and life itself, the answer becomes clear. I want to have children because I am human, and that’s what humans do. Humans become happy when they are moral beings because it is especially in our nature. We are more conscious than most species because of our social nature. Our higher level thinking has arisen, through evolution, specifically as a result of our need to navigate social intricacies. We are fundamentally connected with each other and when we act like it we reap personal internal rewards.\n\n",
    "rejected": "I would dispute the notion that life is a constant suffering. Surely you don't live every single moment of your day in suffering. The human mind is not that powerful. If we didn't occasionally become distracted from any suffering that we do face in our lives, then we wouldn't be able to function properly. The vast majority of all people experience fleeting moments of happiness.\n\n\nAdditionally, the nature of suffering is something which many philosophers have attempted to understand. I'm partial to the Buddhist interpretation, which is that suffering is caused by unfulfilled desires and distractions from the reality of our lives. A seemingly well-off person who revels in fantasy all day long may be considerably more unhappy than a poor person who spends time trying to enjoy the life they actually live. To want something and not have it is often a cause of suffering. A common counter-point to this may be that perhaps someone is in poor health and experiences physical pain as a result. Excluding only the most extreme examples where pain simply cannot be managed, what is the suffering truly caused by? Most likely the bitterness at lacking in physical comfort or ability. However, one who embraces the reality of their health and works to maximize happiness within their limitations can still be a very happy person who does not always suffer. I think Stephen Hawking is a great example of a person with extreme physical disability, and yet he has lived a life that by many objective measures is considerably more fulfilling than the average person's.\n\n\nNow we must consider suicide as a mechanism for rectifying the problem of meaning. Suicide is just about the only way that you can completely remove all possibility of meaning and happiness from your life. Therefore, I would consider the premise that suicide is a solution to this problem a complete contradiction. The fact that you haven't killed yourself seems to suggest that you may recognize this on some level."

    "prompt": "I believe there is no good reason - other than vanity and narcissism - that an infertile couple should opt for IVF over adoption. Please CMV.",
    "chosen": "I've argued in defense of your position in response to others, and I do think that the other posters are a bit off the mark. However, although my wife and I are in the middle of the adoption process and are doing it by choice, there are some things I can say that might make IVF seem more reasonable to you.\n\nAs I said elsewhere, among the most common issues with both adoption and IVF are cost, stress, and family acceptance. I honestly think that the two are roughly equal for those issues *on average*. But your CMV wasn't talking about the average - you said \" I simply have not come across a compelling argument for IVF that makes reasonable sense to me.\" When you think about the specific situations in which many couples find themselves, though, those arguments become clear.\n\nThe cost issue brings up a very simple situation: many good health insurance plans cover IVF the same as any other medical issue. For couples with that insurance, the comparison looks like this:\n\n* IVF: out-of-pocket annual maximum of ~$3,000-$10,000\n* Adoption: An unsubsidized cost of ~$25,000-$40,000\n\nAll else equal, that gives about twenty to thirty thousand good reasons for many couples to choose IVF.\n\nSo, stress. My wife and I started the adoption process when we lived in Kentucky. Believe it or not, adoption is still done on a statewide basis. And, Kentucky was not a place conducive to adoption for us, specifically. Most adoption agencies are religiously affiliated and, in that part of the country, they can and do exclude parents based on religion (don't get me started on that). My wife is Protestant and I am atheist. That eliminated three of the five agencies in the state. Because we were choosing to adopt, one of the remaining agencies wouldn't work with us - it was for infertile couples only (don't get me started on that, either). So we had no choice whatsoever in who to work with, and we did not like the remaining agency. Adoption is not something you want to go through without having complete faith in the organization across the table from you. Had we stayed there, adoption would have been a much tougher road for us and would have made IVF seem like a better option (if infertility was why we were adopting).\n\nLast, and fairly straightforward, is family acceptance. There are a lot of extended families that don't understand or approve of adoption. Now, I'm adopted, and my sister is adopted, and there is a part of me that wants to punch people like that in the face for what they must think of my family. But regardless, those people exist and they exist in clusters. If I was infertile and my parents, siblings, and aunts and uncles wouldn't be supportive of adoption, I would be hard pressed to go ahead and do it in spite of them. That's just asking for a lifetime of ostracization, hushed conversations at family gatherings, and a really shitty environment for my child.\n\nYou will not find a bigger supporter of adoption than me. And I think that a large percentage of the people opting for IVF could - and should - probably have chosen adoption. But that percentage is definitely not 100.",

Depending on the preconditions the insurance covers 50% to 100% of the costs. In some of the German \"states\" the state itself covers another 25% of your personal costs.\n\nNow of course \"expensive\" is a very subjective thing, but even if you would have to pay the 2000€ all by yourself, I wouldn't call it \"insanely expensive\" if you have a normal job. \n\nSo much about the costs part.\n\nPersonally I would choose IVF over adoption, because I want it to be my child.

Race is real like money, and national borders, and adoption, and the meaning of these squiggles I'm writing with--it's real because enough people collectively agreed that it was real and gave it importance. It isn't biologically or intrinsically real (even though we tried to find its 'location' so to speak) and it *shouldn't* matter, but thanks to the actions of the past (and present) it continues to be real. Racism makes no sense because these differences are based in our treatment of each other, our preference for one person or another, our limiting of people by their colour or nationality...not on something inherent. Racism treats people according to how we *think* they are as a category, not who they are as a person or a biological being.\n\nThese erroneous thoughts have consequences. I think we can agree that it would be foolish to say \"race has no biological basis, therefore slavery had nothing to do with dark skin.\" Equally, these past actions continued to have effects with each passing generation. For example, we know that (regardless of race) people whose parents didn't go to college are themselves less likely to go to college. We know that people whose parents are poor will not inherit much money, and therefore have less assistance. We know that people whose parents were incarcerated are more likely to be incarcerated.

My girlfriend is 3 times more likely to be raped than my sister, because my girlfriend is Native American.

Are you doing it? I doubt it. Especially not on purpose, right?

This logic works under the pretense that they know the \"required distance\" for a mental difference when they in fact don't, in fact I'm sure there's no specific distance period. They have no right to make such a claim because they do not have a frame of reference. The bottom line is if there's enough distance for what we already acknowledge to be different, there's no reason to deny mental differences too.\n\nThe people who say race is a social construct, the smarter ones, don't REALLY believe most of it. It just makes their work more defensible and allows them to shield themselves from criticism. It is also essentially a defense mechanism to avoid acknowledging a potentially offensive politically incorrect fact down the road. I'll grant that \"white\" is a social construct; in the past it was applied to different groups, and even nowadays there's probably more distance between a Greek and a Norwegian than there is between a Greek and an Arab (yet the Greek and Norwegian would be considered white, but the Arab would not be considered white), but that's at best a red herring."

For example, an evangelical will claim that Genesis is a scientific account that contradicts evolution while a Catholic will tell you that Genesis is a vehicle of spiritual wisdom that supplements the scientific facts of evolution.  \n\nChristians don't agree on what the Bible is, whether or not the it actually condemns homosexuality or if it even matters.\n\n\nFurthermore, many Christians argue that all people are sinners.

    "chosen": "The word \"discrimination\" has a long history. Original it meant (primarily) telling the difference between two things. We still use it this way sometimes - for example, when we say someone is a \"discriminating judge\" or has \"discriminating taste\", it's always a compliment - but in our century, \"to discriminate\" sees neutral use only in formal contexts. Apparently it was a victim of the euphemism\n treadmill: bigots began describing bigoted behavior as \"discriminating\", ie \"noticing the differences between people\", to draw attention away from the fact that it was morally dubious, and so as a result \"to discriminate\" came to mean \"to treat different people differently, in a morally dubious way\". But a *third* sense evolved, later on, when the US federal courts had to decide what, exactly, the civil rights laws banning discrimination *meant*. They read the laws according to the doctrine of *protected classes\" - that is to say, that purpose of civil rights laws wasn't to ban *all* forms of differential treatment, or even to ban all *morally dubious* forms of differential treatment, but to remedy historical mistreatment of certain groups of people whose civil rights had been denied to them. These were the \"protected classes\" and, while the courts were not trying to change he meaning of the *word \"discrimination\"*, they did rule that in cases of ambiguity, federal anti-discrimination laws were to be interpreted narrowly to protect those classes.\n\nSo we have three senses: a technical-etymological sense, a (nearly universal) ethical sense, and a legal sense. None of the senses is wrong, you just need to make sure you're using the terms the same way. It sounds like you are somewhere between 1 and 2: any kind of differentiating between people is *potentially* discriminatory, and it actually *is* discrimination if it is also morally dubious. But it sounds like they are using something somewhere between 2 and a loose version of 3: if it picks out a protected class to the disadvantage of that class, it's potentially discrimination, and if it's also morally dubious, it *is* discrimination.\n\nJust move into more basic terms if you want to have these conversations.

Children were taken against the will of their parents and themselves. The boarding schools were horrendous environments rife with physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. Essentially, the government is largely responsible for the continued ruin of many Native American communities. \n\nNow, if the government decided to provide Native American individuals or communities with \"special help\" in the form of aid, affirmative action, or other concessions, that would be \"discrimination\" (since the government is specifically providing assistance to one ethnic group while not doing it for other ethnic groups.) \n\nBut one could argue that the only reason special assistance is required is because of factors outside of the control of Native Americans (the US government forcibly destroying communities and individual lives.) So any special assistance is essentially \"righting a wrong.\"\n\nWith black people, there are other forms of discrimination that affirmative action is intended to counter-act (like the fact that having a \"black-sounding name\" during an interview process puts someone at a disadvantage compared to someone with a \"white-sounding name.\")\n\nSo, yes, affirmative action is discrimination- but not quite in the way you make it out to be."

This is an especially large problem when dealing with the law where interpretation of a given case, statement or law is the difference between success and failure.  So if only for the most basic reasons, if you have one country, you need one language to be the primary one.

This means that once the countries are united, *everyone* needs to eliminate their social programs and start over with a much larger country in mind.  This will be *fantastic* for the poor countries that have little to no social safety net.  But this will mean that the bar will be significantly lowered for more lucrative countries.  \n\n**Political Parties**: Each country has it's own political preference.

EU has their standards for grouping countries and after the third bailout with Greece, it's unlikely that they will be changing their minds.

That is, if you and another person (or two, or three..) want to apply to be legally considered a financial unit, you do the paperwork, appear in person before an accredited licensor and declare your intent, sign the agreement, and send it to the government.  \nThat now changes your legal status to one functionally similar to what is now called marriage. \nHowever, it is merely a legal proceeding. Because that's all 'legal marriage' is. Marriage is a social custom. Often it was tied to whatever religion the group had where social customs were tied to the religion. But at heart, it's social. The government has never had anything to do with it.  \n\nIt's not the business of the government to decide what 'marriage' is or who can 'marry'. The only thing the government should be involved in is the legal aspects of it that affect government things like taxes, next of kin, and such.  So the government should completely remove the word that causes the issues, and call it what it is. And everyone of legal age should be equally eligible as the law requires.  \n\nIt should work just like a birth.  A person is born, and you register it with the government.  \n\n-----\n\nThen if a church wants to offer 'marriage' to their congregation, they are welcome to.  But that is merely a social ceremony within the church. For most people, that is what validates it - vows in front of the community, whether that is a church, a group of friends, or anything else.  Once you have your 'marriage' or 'handfasting' or 'sealing' or anything else you want, you then register your intent of legal partnership with the government.  \n\n",
    "rejected": "You've made a great post here, because I think it addresses a lot of important issues regarding the institution of marriage in general, as well as the problems that have arisen from the way it is instituted.\n\nWith that said, I aim to *change* your view, but I cannot (and do not want to) precisely reverse it. I do not want you to believe the opposite of the belief you listed (the opposite being: \"the government should be/stay *in* the marriage business and *not* leave it to the churches). \n\nMy argument is that all legal restrictions on marriage come fundamentally from the government, as directed by the church--and furthermore, that it is impossible and wrong for a government to force churches to abide by definitions of marriage that the government itself sets forth. What this means is that there is no good reason for the government to be involved in marriage at all. In fact, because it regulates the institution and outlaws certain marriages, the government is a removable obstacle to marriage.\n\nYou mentioned that:\n&gt; marriage has become a social contract between two people\n\nVery true - and as a social contract between two people, where is the need for the legal validation by an external government body? When two people \"[declare] to the world and to each other their commitment to their relationship\", why must a government oversee the procedure? You may hold that there are certain rights and privileges associated with marriage which must be enforced by the government, but on what are these privileges founded? Perhaps we would like society to encourage marriage, and for this reason have government associate certain privileges with marriage. But that's at the very least a debatable idea, and many believe that there should be no legal benefits associated with marriage, as providing such benefits is a form of legislating morality. A better system would allow people to associate in marriage as they themselves saw fit, whether it involves a religious institution or not, and afford no arbitrary legal protections to people who decide to partake in marriage.\n\n&gt; Why is a church or religion a necessary player in meeting these ends?\n\nYou're right: the church is not a necessary player in meeting these ends. And for exactly the same reasons, neither is any government. All of the points you presented questioning the role of churches in marriage apply brilliantly to questioning the role of government in marriage, especially in the second paragraph of your post. You said, \"where I have a problem is when they start to deny marriage to people based on sexual orientation or some other factor...\" Simply imagine that the \"they\" you refer to is \"the government\", and you're most of the way to my point: because that's what the government does currently. \nOf course, the government makes these restrictions now *in misguided adherence* to the principles of the church, so the church might be seen as the underlying problem. And maybe it is. But as you said (and because I agree), neither of us is opposed to churches officiating marriages of their own in some way. The problem arises when churches are able to harness the power of the government to enforce their moral judgments on others.\n\nSo, by removing the role of government in marriage altogether, and allowing private contracts between two people to be officiated only as the participants and the churches they may (or may not) wish to respect see fit, restrictions on marriage are lifted and adults may act more freely. In particular, homosexuals would have no trouble finding one of the many churches willing to marry them after the effective legal authority of the opposing (majority) churches is removed.\n"

    "chosen": "Man, this is like CMV's favorite topic!\n\nCutting to the quick: your argument is not 'wrong', in the sense that you've set up an inarguable tautology. However, it is wrong in the sense that your argument hinges on using definitions in unconventional and extreme ways to the point of meaninglessness.\n\nLet's play the definition game:\n\nAltruism: the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others.\n\nOkay, that could be ambiguous, let's look at what selfless means:\n\nSelfless: concerned more with the needs and wishes of others than with one's own; unselfish.\n\nAnd right there is the key word that renders this argument moot: 'more'. Not concerned EXCLUSIVELY or concerned ENTIRELY but just concerned MORE. Because in real life and real conversation, when we talk about altruism or selflessness or whatever, we're not defining the words in a vacuum, we're defining them relative to other acts. In other words, if no acts are altruistic, the word 'altruistic' is just a collection of letters and not worth discussing. 'Selfishness' and 'altruism' only make sense if there is a continuum. Put differently, saying 'all acts are selfish so altruism doesn't exist' is like saying 'everything on the planet earth is hot because nothing is as cold as the vacuum of space'. Okay, it's true, but so what? That's not how anyone actually uses the word hot and cold.\n\nDefining altruism like this is like saying 'All actions are motivated by glarglebargle, and glarglebargle is defined as anything that motivates an action, CMV.' Sure, you're 'right', but you're only 'right' in the sense that you made up a definition. In both practical and technical usage, these words refer to 'acts which benefit another more than they benefit the self'. The extremes you're pointing to are irrelevant.",
    "rejected": "Alright, let's take the situation you gave. You give all your money to charity to satisfy a guilt of having money when everyone else doesn't. This seems selfish. But why do you have the guilt? You have the guilt because you intrinsically have a desire to help others. If you didn't have the desire to help others, why would you feel happy when you did so? The very fact you're happy means that you've satisfied a desire within you, that is, the desire to help others.\n\nA desire to help others can hardly be called selfish. That's the exact opposite of selfish, by definition. Just because you got something good out of it (happiness) doesn't mean that the action is selfish. Thus, actions motivated by selfless desires do exist."

    "prompt": "By raising a family in the suburbs, the parents are condemning the children to boredom, dependence, inactivity, and expense.",
    "chosen": "&gt;For one, my idea of an \"urban\" area is one where most amenities are in range of walking, biking, or a relatively short bus ride. This includes schools, shops, parks, etc. This was brought up in the past AMA, but the discussion didn't really include a comparison of accessibility. Cities can generally be navigated without a car because they usually preceded the car. Suburbs, on the other hand, were designed explicitly around cars: the feasibility of walking wasn't taken into consideration by planners, developers, or business owners when placing public spaces and private businesses.\n\nGrowing up, I had a few fun places within a easy bike ride or walking distance.  I mostly ended up spending my summers at the local pool, because I loved swimming so much, but there were also some nearby parks and fields that I could have spent my time in.  As I got older, I spent most of my time at the high school which was within walking distance (about a 1/4 mile).\n\n&gt;Where the urban 10-year old who wants to play soccer, see his friends or buy an ice-cream cone can simply get up and go, the suburban kid has to ask her parents, who then have to agree to take time out of their day to drive her down.\n\nWhen I was ten, if I wanted to play soccer, all I needed was to take the ball into the back yard.  This was also true of sledding in the winter, climbing trees, digging up rocks, and most other fun things I would want to do as a ten year old.  Some things were better done in the front, where we would utilize the black top of our seldom trafficked cul-de-sac to play basketball, baseball, hockey, and many other things.  Your ice cream point would also have been irrelevant to me as a 10 year old, because while there was an ice cream van that came by regularly, my parents would never let me have any because they wanted to control my sugar intake.  At that age, even if I had access to the money (which I did) and a non moving store, my parents would still have disallowed buying ice cream and would have punished me if I had taken the initiative to do so on my own.\n\n&gt;When she turns 16, the suburban kid does have the option of getting a car. However, this means thousands of dollars have to be dedicated to getting the independence and freedom that the urban kid has already had for years. The urban 16-year-old is more likely to spend money from a job on something other than basic transportation.\n\nRaised in the suburbs and I didn't get a car until I was 19.  Even then, it was a car that my parents would have sold for not very much money when they got a new one, but instead gave to me.  At the age of 24 I have only within the last month bought my own car for the first time.\n\n&gt;These criticisms also all apply to rural areas, but those have one critical offset: access to space. My childhood was spent between rural western Washington state and rural eastern Oregon. In both cases, though my neighborhoods might have resembled suburbs, there was a lot of undeveloped, unfenced land around. My friends might have had to be dropped off by their parents, but once they were there, we went exploring in the woods or desert, built forts, rode bikes, played war. When I got older, we could play paintball. Other kids in the neighborhood rode dirt bikes. Though we didn't have access to ball fields or libraries in walking distance, we did have the forest (W Washington) or desert (E Oregon) as a playground. Other rural kids that I have known have learned to build small structures, raised livestock, or learned target shooting.\n\nI do agree with you that rural environments provide much better situations for children than the suburbs do, but I think that you are underestimating the access to some of these things that some suburbs provide.  In the house I currently live in (still very much suburbs), it backs to woods and a small creek.  A short walk away is a local park with more developed woods (read, larger uninterrupted acreage) and a thriving stream system.  It isn't as much as I can get when I'm in the mountains, but it isn't non existent.  As for the things the rural kids you know learned how to do, I did learn most of those while growing up.  I built structures with my dad, helped my mom in our vegetable garden (not livestock, but a similar usefulness of the skill), and I learned how to shoot through my high school on a competitive team (I have been to competitions recently where I am competing against mostly rural people who grew up shooting and hunting, and I beat them all).\n\n&gt;They will be less likely to exercise, because more barriers are thrown into their way.\n\nWhere I am, there are more youth athletic programs than I know what to do with, and I would be hard pressed to find someone who didn't do any growing up.  Every neighborhood has a pool within walking distance and my high school regularly is competing for the state championship in some sport or another and producing NCAA athletes, even a few for that went pro.\n\nOverall, I find myself unable to imagine what it would be like to raise a kid in a city, because that lack of space would kill any sort of fun activity I could think of them doing besides staying at home and being couch potatoes.  I think that a rural environment is ideal, but the suburbs can work fine if you need to be near a city for work.",
    "rejected": "Boredom: I had a huge yard as a kid. I could play in the woods and build forts, take my dog for a walk or run around with him, go down the street to my neighborhood park, go for a bike ride, etc. It also wasn't a huge deal to be out past dark, while it is kind of dangerous to do so in most cities.\n\nDependence:I could ride my bike to places I wanted to go. If it was too far to bike then, yeah, I needed to ask for a ride, but I imagine I only would have been allowed to use public transportation alone a couple of years before getting my license anyways. I got a job when I was 15, never had an allowance, and generally learned to take care of myself. \n\ninactivity: again, lots of bike riding, park playing, playing tag in the street, running around with my dog, exploring the woods, etc. Not only was I plenty active, but my *play* was active. You seem to be saying city kids get more activity through transit, which is all well and good, but I got plenty of activity just by playing and being a kid. The lack of people and traffic around allowed me to do so quite freely.\n\nexpense: This may vary by state or region (so may not be true where you live), but where I live it is much more expensive to live in the city than in the suburbs. A house will cost you roughly $800-$1000/mo for 3-4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and roughly 2,000 SF in a nice neighborhood, in the county I live in. Renting, rather than owning, the same house might cost $1,200-$1,300/mo. In the city it is $1,200++/mo for a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment that is between 800-1,000 SF. $2,000/mo and up in a nicer complex/better part of town. This is significantly less space for the money. Plus in most of these places you have to pay extra for a parking space in the city. Plus taxes are higher in the city, utilities (like water) are more expensive, and it's more difficult to find fresh vegetables at a reasonable price. My city is not large enough for a metro, we only have buses. But the closest major city with a metro to where I live, it costs $250 for monthly access to it. Between gas and insurance, and the occasional repair, maintaining a car is about the same (if not less). Sure, you have the buy the car upfront, but most kids don't need a car often enough to need their own, they can just borrow one of their parents when they need to.\n\nNot to mention that the schools are typically of a lesser quality in the city than in counties, and this holds true where I live. My county's schools are very highly rated, while my city's schools are not. So now the child either has to get a weaker education, or the parents have to spend more money enrolling them into (and getting them to) a private school or a school in a neighboring county.\n\nCities usually are also usually more dangerous and have a higher crime rate than the suburbs.\n\nAgain, all of the above is based on my experience in the county I live in vs. the city a few miles down the road. You're experience may be different. This is very dependent on where one lives."

Webcomics would be largely unaffected - free or cheap hosting is too easily available and webcomics with only a few exceptions are low traffic, and those exceptions can generally leverage many income streams other than ads (and do). Reddit? Reddit I have no idea, by all rights it should have died already.\n\nIn general, the web would see the fall of content farms and aggregate sites (who subsist on ad revenue primarily), and a number of large content community sites would also hit the dust or become commercialized. Sites dealing with extreme traffic of video, and to a lesser extent images would also take a huge hit and content sharing would become drastically more decentralized. Some small dross sites and bloggers that exist to push ads and affiliate links would die. Otherwise, probably not much effect.\n\nIt's hard to kill the free web via ads when literally every person connected to the net can host a small site off their home computer for less than 100$ a year, and often completely free.",
    "rejected": "Yes, some sites will make less money. These will be sites like BuzzFeed etc where the goal is click bait and user farming (quantity over quality).\n\nHowever, we'll see a rise in alternate forms of advertising. For example, it will be more and more common to see product placement (example: that car from Walking Dead), content advertising (example: old spice ads, or company blogs), and voluntary fundraising (example: reddit gold).\n\nMore sites might adopt a freemium model. For example: Pandora and Trello, where the features are free, yet they offer a paid option that makes a better experience for their top users.\n\nTL;DR: There are many options for websites to generate revenue then to \"pay-wall\" content and force paid models."

Therefore, in the rare cases where that *does* occur, there must be some other proximate cause.

    "chosen": "I'l begin by saying it has never happened to me, and you make some good points. But I'm addicted to CMV, so here we go.  \n\n&gt;sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not the most important part. \n\nSo it is one of the most important parts. To break it would be to break one of the most important parts of a marriage. I'll continue.\n\n*edit: even if you value it not at all, cheating breaks other important parts of the relationship. Like trust. Loyalty. Companionship.\n\n&gt;Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end. \n\nYou are correct that this is false. However, cheating on a spouse is  *pretty big mistake*. Cheating, as I define it, is a choice. A bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of marriage. \n\n&gt;Cheaters will always cheat again\n\nYou are correct that this is false. However, I would say that *cheaters are more likely to cheat again*. The circumstances that resulted in cheating the first time may repeat. \n\n&gt;Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship. My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. \n\nYes. But \"talking about the problem\" is an ideal situation. It often doesn't work out so well that way. People get stuck in a pattern... living in the same house, married to the same person you stopped really caring about. Cheating is evidence that *something* must be wrong. \n\nSo, so far we can say cheating\n\n* is a bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of a relationship\n\n* is an indication that such a thing will happen again\n\n* is an indication that there is a problem with the relationship\n\nAre there no situations in which the cheaters should be forgiven? I'm trying to argue that if you find your spouse cheating, breaking up with them is the most logical thing to do, whatever the circumstances. \n\nI point out, cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on. You have every reason to break up. \n\nIn my mind, marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken. One partner isn't fulfilling all of his/her obligations (i.e. not to cheat) So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his/hers? Why should you stay married?\n\nIt is entirely up to the person making the decision as to what they may do. It's an ethical question, and everyone has their different values, so it's impossible to prove definitively what you should/should not do. It's just a logical conclusion that breaking up is the right choice in most if not all situations. It's a choice.\n\nBut if you don't break up, you are stuck with a person who doesn't value you enough to stay loyal. Why would you forfeit yourself to such a relationship?\n\nThings need change. And the cheater is the source of the problem. Change the cheater by breaking up with him/her. ",
    "rejected": "Well, I can only give you my experiences with cheating, and why I think it means the end of the relationship based on what I know. I know anecdotal evidence isn't the best for an argument, but hear me out. I've had two long-term partners that cheated on me, and I'll try to address each of your points individually.\n\nIt wasn't that sex was the most important part of either relationship; the sex was good in both situations, and I'm a very liberal person when it comes to sexuality. I would have even been okay with being in an open relationship, if they would have at least been honest with me about it, and that's the thing--it wasn't about them having sex with other women. It was the dishonesty of what they were doing, the constant lies, the betrayal of my trust, the vomiting of half-assed excuses when I found out… one even 'borrowed money for the bus' which he really used to buy drugs for his girlfriends. And can you imagine what it's like to lie down in an empty bed at night knowing the man you love is out somewhere, fucking another woman, making up bullshit reasons as to why he can't make it home for another few hours? \n\nI'm a forgiving person, I know people make mistakes. But cheating is not one little mistake. There are quite a few steps involved before the act itself is carried out. You generally have to meet someone, become acquainted, start flirting and finally make romantic advances before actually physically cheating on your partner. I think most people would consider everything after flirting to be a mistake, and that you shouldn't advance any further than that. However, like I said, I am a forgiving person. In both instances, I forgave the first betrayal because I do believe that people can change.\n\nActually, I *know* that people do change. I have seen people make amazing turnarounds in their lives. It's not fair to say that a cheater will always be a cheater, because they could change, if they wanted to. But the thing is, I believe many cheaters don't really *want* to change in time for the relationship to be saved. What happened in my situation was that my partners caught on very quickly, and realized that no matter how many times they cheated, I would still forgive them. Neither started cheating immediately after I took them back, which is why I thought maybe they'd changed. My first boyfriend cheated on me with seven other women in total. I don't think he became a 'serial cheater' until the third offense. After that, it was just a free-for-all and he did not seem to care if he got caught. That's when I knew things had gone way too far and I was out, finally. After my second boyfriend cheated on me twice, I decided not to get burned again, and was correct--the relationship was not worth the risk. I believe that they are both in relationships now and I think one actually is married, so it seems like hopefully they have changed, but not for me. So it's possible even that breaking up with them may have allowed for that change. Like I said, it was just not for me.\n\nAs far as there being underlying issues in the relationship… well, there were a lot of those, too, in hindsight. Which is why a breakup was probably inevitable in the first place. Cheating was a symptom, not a cause.\n\nWell, I could have stayed and maybe worked things out with them, but all these years later… who cares? I'm in a healthy relationship and life is good. It feels weird even thinking about these guys. My boyfriend was also the victim of a 'serial cheater' and I think that's why we both value fidelity and loyalty in our relationship so much now. I guess that's what pretty much leads me up to my summation:\n\nCheating sucks. It hurts a lot to get cheated on, and even though mistakes can be forgiven, they *do* add up. People can change, if they want to, but they don't always *want* to in time for things to be saved. Sometimes, the relationship is not worth the heartache."

    "chosen": "My previous self can relate to you, I can still relate to you a bit on this.\nIt wasn't until last year, half way through my age of 22, was I convinced to try getting \"drunk\" under a completely safe environment (trustworthy people who were experienced with alcohol, knew to keep plenty of water in me, have lots of food available, only drink while in a positive attitude to begin with and an available option for sober transportation if anything happened to me). And this opened up my mind. It blew me away that I was still \"me\" under the influence. I wasn't this person who runs loose without rules and is completely unaware of what I'm doing.\nIf you get drunk and do something stupid, chances are, the temptation to do those stupid things were already there when you were sober. It's just that alcohol lowers your inhibitions, and your temptations become easy to act on. If you're already angry, if you're already whatever, that is going to shine when you get drunk.\nSo if you work on temptations before you get drunk, you lessen the possibility of being stupid. Even when I'm drunk, I wouldn't ever get behind the wheel and think I can drive, I wouldn't imagine cheating on my significant other, I wouldn't try to fly by jumping off the roof... because those temptations are not there for me while I'm sober.\nAs for problems that actually require rational thinking, and quite a bit of it to find a solution, I can still do them while drunk, it just takes me a while. And I have an automatic reflex NOT to act until my rationality has hit me.\nMaybe other people don't react to alcohol this way and I've just been fortunate that I and those who have helped me have these experiences do in act react this way. But it's certainly not inherently bad based on how people act with it. They just don't handle it in an effective and positive way.",

The idea is that we all get together, have some drinks, and lower our inhibitions enough to admit we are just stupid organic humans with very base needs. \n\nDrinking builds a comradery between people because you are willing to take more social risk and the group is more willing to except you due to their own inebriation. I think modern society puts so much pressure on people to follow the rules and be good little humans that it takes a drink or two for some to be able to let loose and forget these pressures (especially in a group setting someone is unfamiliar with).\n\nDrinking is something you make your own. Some abuse it, other choose not to use it. You not having a desire to drink cannot be changed by anyone but yourself. You need to find your own reasons to enjoy drinking, or decide it is not for you. \n\nIf you feel pressure for not drinking, have one bottled beer at a party then fill it with tap water the rest of the night.

Take Rolls Royce, for example, verses Toyota Avalon. \n\nRolls Royce:\n\n* Handcrafted \"book matched\" wood with inlays\n* Perfect full grain leather\n* Hand-welded aluminum body\n* Hand-built engine, signed by maker\n* Engine in an exotic configuration\n* Wool carpets\n* Perfect hand-sprayed and polished paint\n* Pin stripes and coach lines painted by hand by the only person in the world with a hand steady enough to do so\n* Extremely rigorous quality control\n* Completely customizable---and not just from a list, they will make anything you wish\n* Majority of parts made in England\n* Double-paned glass\n* Exclusivity\n* There is no little sticker that says (sic) the brand name; the \"Spirit of Ecstasy\" is made of sterling silver and retracts into the hood\n\nToyota:\n\n* Made on an assembly line\n* Lower quality leather\n* Body unit the same as the Camry\n* Not hand welded, not made from aluminum\n* Engine mass made\n* Engine a V6\n* Wood thin veneer\n* Lots of plastics\n* Mass-made\n* Lots of automation\n* Low QC and numerous flaws\n\nA significant number of Rolls Royces are still on the road (65%), whereas the same is not true for Toyotas. This kind of a luxury car is built to last a life-time, and this is why they hold their value so well, and part of why they cost so much.\n\nI recommend watching \"Mega Factories Rolls Royce\" on YouTube and you can see the lengths they go to make these cars. It's utterly stunning.\n\nSure, the cheaper car and the more expensive car serve the same basic function of transport, but they differ in terms of quality. These are not mass-made cars that have hyper-inflated costs because of a brand name. They are hand crafted from the absolute best materials, using the best techniques, and the best design. So in this regard they do not serve the same function as lower end Buicks or Cadillacs because these cars do not share the mark of high quality, which comprises the difference in price. In short, part of their function is to be perfect and extremely high quality. \n\nAnother element most people don't consider (yet value quite highly) is that the person crafting this Rolls Royce etc. is a highly trained, highly skilled craftsperson working in very favorable conditions, doing something they can be very proud of, and are paid well. Toyota, on the other hand, is well-known to use close to slave labor for some of their production. Part of the cost of a high end luxury car is paying and treating people well. ",

The thing about luxury products is that they aren't bought to fill a need, but a want.\n\nYou're probably right that there's a decreasing yield on quality.  But there's also an increasing yield on *image* with such cars.  The difference in perception (perhaps most importantly self-perception) between driving a Rolls Royce and Audi is much larger than between the Audi and a Toyota.\n\nWhen someone buys a luxury products, expensive clothes, watches, yachts, cars, etc it's because they fit some image of that they have of how their life is.  Somewhere in this thread, you describe yourself as a \"minimalist individual.\"  Clearly, Bentleys and Rolls Royces don't fit that image of yourself.

Even the do-gooders do it because it makes them feel good.\n\nFor me personally the core tenants of the redpill are what I apply to my interactions with girls every single time now and it works out well for me. I mean some call me an asshole, but those are the same girls that sooner or later come crawling back.\n\nI'm not bitter about it, or women. I love women and accept them for how they are and personally I prefer how things actually work to the supposed 'disney' fantasy of what has been told. If a woman leaves my harem, why would I mind?

    "prompt": "The black community is perpetuating stereotypes and self-segregating itself.",
    "chosen": "Wow, there is a lot to respond to here.  I'll start out by tackling it point by point.\n\n&gt; There is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty.\n\nFirst off, sports are actually one of the more genuinely meritocratic institutions in this country.  Although realistically most black people will never become professional athletes, sports in school often come with requirements to maintain a certain GPA, and there are a variety of scholarships that colleges offer for athletes.  This is a minor nitpick, but it's not wrong to suggest sports can help some black people out of poverty.\n\nBut that's a minor point.  More importantly, the idea that black people just don't value education is wrong.  Empirically, factually wrong.  [Here is a very interesting article on the subject](http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2013/01/acting_white_theory_black_academic_achievement_based_on_other_factors.html), discussing whether or not black people have a disdain for education and view it as \"acting white.\"  What the various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts.  Black students were more likely to report that their friends wanted them to go to college, a majority of all black students personally plan to go to college, and by far the most common reason for not going was being unable to afford it.  Black people were even slightly more likely to consider high-achieving students \"cool\", and a greater proportion of black people said that their friends would be supportive if they received good grades than white people.  To quote the article:\n\n&gt; For more than three decades, researchers have found that black students consistently exhibit more positive attitudes about education than white students, contrary to their lower levels of academic achievement.\n\nThis raises the question about why black academic achievement is lower.  One possibility is that schools in black neighborhoods have much less funding and larger class sizes that make individualized attention difficult.  Another could be a feeling of being unsafe, which, the linked article notes, is correlated with decreased academic achievement.  \"Stereotype threat\", a phenomenon noted by Claude Steele and discussed at length in his book *Whistling Vivaldi*, describes the way anxiety about confirming a stereotype can result in worse performance on a given task.  Whatever the reason(s), it is not \"black culture\".\n\nNow, on to another argument of yours, OP:\n\n&gt; The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.\n\nRates of violent crime are higher in black communities than white ones.  The problem is that viewing crime in the lens of \"personal responsibility\" or otherwise simply blaming criminals, punishing them, and calling it a day, is intellectually bankrupt and morally irresponsible.  And chalking it up to some vague \"black culture\" and then flooding the neighborhood with cops is certainly not a rational response.  Asking why black on black crime is a problem is a legitimate question, however.  Let's investigate.\n\nFirst, most violent crimes are intraracial- white people are generally more likely to kill other white people, and black people are generally more likely to kill other black people.  You've likely heard this point before so I won't spend much time on it.\n\nOf course, you can counter that black people still commit higher rates of violent crime, and you would be right.  However, the explanation is not as simple as \"black culture\".  [According to one study](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/623/1/93.short):\n\n&gt; Using data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study to examine the racial-spatial dynamic of violence for neighborhoods in thirty-six U.S. cities, the authors demonstrate that along with the social and economic conditions that exist within neighborhoods, proximity to more disadvantaged and especially racially privileged (heavily white) areas is particularly critical in accounting for the large and visible differences in violence found across neighborhoods of different colors.\n\n[Another study](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) finds that \"gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of non-white neighborhoods than in white areas (Figure 5), but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account (Table 2).\"  These critical community conditions?  Differences in access to external resources (such as home loans) and socioeconomic disadvantages.\n\n[A different study](http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/1/93.short) finds that unemployment and underemployment are significantly correlated with willingness to commit crime.  [Black unemployment rates are consistently roughly twice white unemployment rates.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/through-good-times-and-bad-black-unemployment-is-consistently-double-that-of-whites/)  [A white criminal and a black person without a criminal record have roughly the same chance of being hired.](http://csgjusticecenter.org/reentry/posts/researchers-examine-effects-of-a-criminal-record-on-prospects-for-employment/)  It's nearly impossible for black people with criminal records to get jobs, and with the War on Drugs, large numbers of black people have been swept up into the criminal justice system as felons, and permanently denied access to the economy.  Between violent criminals and nonviolent drug offenders, 1/3 of black men will be incarcerated at some point in their lives, which means 1/3 of black men will be disadvantaged in finding employment, and more likely to commit crime as a result.\n\nYou say the black community needs to tackle black on black crime.  And I agree!  It needs to tackle black on black crime by addressing it at its sources- mass incarceration, poverty, lack of services, police brutality, and segregation.  But of course, we have movements dealing with those issues.  One such movement is #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nAnyway, moving on:\n\n&gt; The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like \"All Lives Matter\"\n\nIt is true that white people are often victims of police brutality and mass incarceration.  It's also true that black people are disproportionately victims of those things.  And another thing that is true: black people are more likely than white people to even acknowledge that a problem exists.  By calling attention to a problem white people largely don't want to realize exists, a problem born from post-civil rights movement racism masquerading as a concern for \"law and order\", of course BlackLivesMatter is going to be polarizing.  But it needs to be BlackLivesMatter because of the racist origins of our current system of mass incarceration, the disproportionate police brutality, and the havoc racism continues to inflict on black communities.  To ignore the racial aspects of our current police brutality problem is to fall short of being able to fix it and the system around it.",
    "rejected": "I think your analysis failed to address the historical roots of your points. You don't address where the stereotypes originated, you don't discuss the long term generational effects poverty and mass incarceration have on communities, and you fail to realize how social media has allowed for the dissemination of information on issues black communities face to non-black communities. \n\n&gt;\"Hustlin'\" is glorified while education is not.\n\nWell, this is what happens when you have an education system that has time and time again failed black communities in urban areas. I highly recommend listening to [this](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) episode of This American Life. It touches on the huge discrepancies between the education white kids receive and black kids receive in St. Louis but it's just one example that can be applied to urban communities across the country. \n\n &gt;However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight.\n\nPolice brutality is another example of how a system that is meant to protect people fails to protect black communities. I don't understand why you think it's not important to address. Mike Brown's case is not only a case of a white cop killing a black boy, but an example of economic and social disparities in white and black neighborhoods. Black Lives Matters isn't about polarizing the country. Why should this issue even be polarizing? That's the main problem. Why are people still arguing that systemic racism isn't an issue in this country? That's what BLM protestors are trying to move away from - we aren't arguing anymore that race is a problem in this country, right now we're trying to address the problems of the institutions in this country. And to be honest it is working. After the two BLM protestors shut down Bernie Sander's event what happened? He released his platform on racial justice and has talked about mass incarnations and the issues of private prisons in this country. \n\nI think you barely grazed the surface with your analysis. It's important to look into the psychological effects systemic racism has on communities. Black communities don't trust the very institutions you think we should trust (education, police force, etc). Saying black communities should cooperate and let go of very important aspects of our culture (hip-hop, music, sports) is in and of itself oppressive. Black people in this country were never given the power to address these issues for themselves, they weren't even considered people since the day they were brought to this country, because of this we have to rely on our communities to fight for ourselves and make these issues more heard. [Here's](http://www.thenation.com/article/black-lives-matter-is-a-demand-not-a-plea/) a piece that highlights why that is important. \n\n"

That's not to say niche-appeal content would go away altogether, but niche-appeal content that's more than a pittance to license probably would.\n\nMoreover, ads on Netflix wouldn't have the same value to advertisers as ads on even live cable networks have. In spite of the seeming appeal of being able to customize ads to specific demographics, the vast majority of streaming video services tend to have a small number of ads that run ad infinitum, no pun intended, almost more like the service has a single sponsor rather than plural advertisers.\n\nWhy?\n\n[Upfronts.](http://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-madness-of-tv-upfronts-2013-5) A ridiculously shady and corrupt process of auctioning off TV ad time with zero transparency of prices that's inflated network TV ad prices for decades. Without participation in that kind of process—and more importantly, without the kind of live, gotta-watch-it-while-it's-airing content that defines TV—you don't get that kind of money.\n\nI'll concede that Netflix might, someday, benefit from having ads. But the way advertising is done will have to change dramatically first, in order to make it worthwhile for Netflix—and the bubble that makes advertising so lucrative for broadcast TV will have to burst first.",
    "rejected": "It would come across as double dipping. You have to consider that there already exists *free* sites, like Hulu and Crackle, where you can legally stream movies and tv series. The reason they are free is because the companies profit from ad revenue instead of paid subscriptions. Most people are willing to watch a few commercials since they realize (a) It's free and (b) It's only free *because* of the commercials.  \n\nNetflix charges a subscription fee.  If they also include ads that means they are not only taking in ad revenue, but also profiting from the paid subscribers. In other words, double dipping. People most likely will not tolerate it because if they wanted to stream with commercials they would just turn to sites like Hulu and Crackle instead of shelling out money for a Netflix subscription. They are paying for ad free access to Netflix's catalog. If Netflix no longer has this benefit then why not turn to another streaming site?\n\nNot mention the competition is getting more heated. First, you have Amazon Prime, which not only allows streaming, rental, and digital download purchases, but it also includes 2 day shipping on specific items to Prime members. Amazon Prime is also investing in their own original content.  \n\nSecond, most networks are allowing streaming of their shows. I know when I miss Once Upon a Time I can just stream it from the ABC site. But cable networks are also allowing streaming, HBO being the latest to launch a standalone stream service.  \n\nMaybe if Netflix was the only horse in the race, but they're not anymore. New sites are forming, powerhouse businesses like Amazon are expanding, and networks themselves are also stepping into streaming options. \n\nIncluding ads on top of a subscription fee would just make consumers look more closely at the competition.\n\n"

While animals are obviously not regarded the same as humans, we still agree largely agree that they are conscious beings worth of *some* consideration.

Biological diversity is valuable, and ecological relationships are fragile. While you can argue that a rhino in general is of no use to humans, if the rhino population suddenly declines in an area due to poaching etc. this will have far reaching consequences for other plants/animals in that region, some of which we might depend upon for survival. Plus, from a direct economic standpoint, extinction of wildlife in Africa will cause several countries to lose tourism revenue from foreigners, which they greatly rely upon."

Withdrawal can last a ridiculously long time, and can have many detrimental effects. Chemical dependencies are particularly rough for this. You seem to misunderstand how the brain works a bit. It's not like \"oh, I apologize too much, I gotta remind myself not to apologize as frequently\" habit. It's a thing your brain thinks you **need** and will respond as though something has gone very drastically if it thinks its not getting the thing it needs.",

Psychological addiction is the brain saying \"dude you need this, go get it\", a little like an incredibly strong habit. People with a psychological addiction may suffer withdrawal symptoms, but they are purely psychosomatic. Physiological addiction however is different. It will only occur with certain substances, but once the physiological addiction sets in the body quickly becomes dependant upon the substance, no longer able to function properly without it. Take away the substance and the withdrawal is pretty horrific, seizures, blacking out, sometimes comas or even death in extreme cases.\n\nIn both cases once the addiction has set in it is at best difficult and at worst impossible to break the addiction without medical treatment. To call it a disease is a misnomer, but to call it a habit is even less accurate.\n\nAs for your first sentence, I consider it wrong on both counts. Firstly because most diseases do disappear quickly with no apparent reason, the person just got better. Secondly (depending on where we draw the line of what is and isn't addiction) breaking an addiction generally requires some form of treatment, albeit not treatment in the same sense that most see it but something more akin to many treatments for mental health issues, though strong physiological addictions do often require drugs and other medical attention."

    "chosen": "I think there's a fundamental problem with your premise. If you look at HOW the war started, you will see more issues with US involvement. The US acted as an aggressor.\n\nThey transformed a struggle that was essentially anti-colonialist (which they should have supported, based on their propaganda about freedom and shit), into a war-of-the-worlds-anti-communist struggle. They supported a corrupt government in the South (just like in Korea before the war there), which had no legitimacy, no credit, and no real power. Why do you think the Viet Cong was so successful? Poor people hated that government. (Just like in Korea, by the way...)\n\nThey also lied about an incident to get involved in the actual war (Gulf of Tonkin), and then they proceeded to massacre between 2 to 4 million of your countryfellows, bombed Laos and Cambodia, and enabled the Khmer Rouge to commit their own atrocities.\n\nHad the US not interfered in the original struggle against the French, there would probably not have been Chinese/Russian involvement in the same extent. The Domino Theory was a paranoid delusion, and it caused immense suffering to your country.\n\nAs for which overlords are better? Look at Latin America, if you want to see what life under US influence is. (Well, was.) Look at Nicaragua, Columbia, El Salvador, Chile, etc... not nice places to live (and die, unless you like being thrown out of airplanes, or killed for demanding 10cent more for the hourly wage of banana pickers). The Commies were not much better, either (I grew up in Central Europe on the other side of the Iron Curtain), but they at least took some social issues seriously, and invested in education, healthcare and other stuff, which were somewhat beneficial, even if it was stupid at times, like pushing for heavy industry in agricultural countries. (Just look how Afghanistan looked like in the 70s...)\n\nThe US involvement was wrong both morally and legally. From there it makes no difference what the outcome would have been; but if you really want to think about it, you might want to look at South Korea on the bright side, or the Philippines, Latin America on the dark side.

Remember though that the Rhee regime, which was supported by the US during the Korean war, was also responsible for massacring 100's of thousands of civilians.

    "prompt": "I think that after all the innocent killed by US air strikes and other attacks, the most dangerous terrorist group nowadays is the US army themselves. CMV.",
    "chosen": "In addition to garnteller's point, which is the crux of the argument against your assertion, that he put quite eloquently I might add, I'd like to make another point.\n\nPeople forget that who we're targeting with drone strikes are actual terrorists, mass murders who use violence against civilian targets to achieve political goals. That they target civilians, while the US accidentally kills civilians, is what garnteller is saying, and it's spot on. However, it's also important to remember what the alternatives to drone strikes are. Aerial bombardment, artillery shelling and soliders on the ground. These are MUCH less discriminate methodologies, and they result in many many more civilian deaths than drone strikes do. Not only is this the method that the US would have used in the past (for example, in Vietnam and Cambodia) but the Pakistani military continues to use them today. When Pakistan knows a village is a Taliban strong hold (and they don't need that Taliban cell for anything at the moment) they just shell the village off the map. Many more innocent lives and property are lost in the process.\n\nI'm going to look for this piece I read recently on the BBC about a Pakistani villager talking about how the drone program is much more preferable to the Pakistani military's approach, and is much more supported in Pakistani tribal areas than we believe, and that those who protest so vehemently against it are actually urban Pakistanis who's main gripe is sovereignty violations because they don't know what it's really like to live in contested areas.\n\nSo what does that leave us? There are really three options:\n\n1: The US military continues it's drone program, which results in a small number of accidental deaths, but effectively decimates the leadership of AQAP and the Pakistani Taliban. It also allows the US to take the blame for the drone strikes, which, in the grand summation of things, is better than the Pakistani government taking the blame for them, as it allows for a better chance for peace negotiations.\n\n2: The US military suspends the drone program, and allows the Pakistanis and the Yemeni government to deal with the terrorists in their own manner, which will kill many more innocents, and fosters domestic hatred toward the government which further radicalizes the population\n\n3:The US ends the drone program, and Yemeni and Pakistani governments do nothing about AQAP and the Taliban, and the Taliban continue their reign of terror, targeting civilians and doing things like exploding bombs on crowded buses and attacking schools the educate girls.\n\nIt's not pretty. It's hard to wrap one's mind around. But the American drone program is BY FAR the best option to deal with militant Islam, and is actually the most discriminate, specific, and accurate weapons platform ever created. It's actually the most humane anti-terrorist program possible. Yes, mistakes are made, there always will be mistakes, but they are just that: Mistakes. The people we're targeting kill civilians on purpose.\n\nAnd just because I know it's coming, as for the argument that \"for ever terrorist killed by a drone strike ten more are created\": While that is a danger, yes, not all terrorists are equal. The US targets leadership, who have experience, who recruit other terrorists, who know how to build bombs. Even if ten more terrorists are created for every one killed by drone strikes (clearly an exaggeration) it's still worth it to kill the one that would have provided them with the weapons, bombs, training and targets, and who would have recruited a hundred more if he were still alive.\n\nAlso, on the subject of double taps, which is brought up all the time: First, there is no conclusive evidence that happens or is widely used. It's been initially reported by biased Pakistani media, and then picked up on by American news sources. Until the New York Times or some other reputable organization, not looking to further their already established argument about the evils of the drones, does their own investigation and reports on it, I wont be convinced that it's as commonly used a practice as people claim it to be. Second, the Taliban's response to a drone strike is to immediately fill the area with their people so they can control the narrative and information that comes out. They don't want people to know how many of their people, and which of their leaders have been killed. If double taps are used, it's in response to that tactic, not the US wanting to kill Pakistani first responders. I assure you, the US isn't killing Pakistanis because it's fun and they like it.\n\nFinally, you're post seems to be a knee-jerk response to the mistake that was made yesterday in that drone strike on that wedding party. You should take a look at what AQAP did a [few days before](http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/05/world/meast/yemen-violence/) specifically targeting a [HOSPTIAL](http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/middle-east/9515348/Shocking-footage-of-Yemen-hospital-attack).

    "rejected": "Technically, the U.S. military could be classified as a terrorist organization. But the connotative understanding of terrorism has had one, big component that conflicts with your view more or less since its birth: terrorists kill innocent people and use the resulting fear as a means of political and/or social change. So, unless you can prove that the U.S. did these attacks intentionally for the explicit purpose of spreading terror, it will conflict with the connotative definition of the word \"terrorist group.\" And since the denotative definition of the word is currently in a state of dispute, the connotative definition is all we have. \n\nInterestingly enough, the term actually *did* originate for a government. The French government, to be exact, during the Reign of Terror. The term quickly became a term of abuse, and about 90 years later, was a self-described term of Russian terrorist organizations that largely resemble organizations such as Al-Quaeda in their tactics and revenge ideology. By the time Franz Ferdinand was shot, this connotation of the word was so largely agreed upon that newspapers all over the world called Gabril Princip and his accomplices terrorists. So by this time, the term has gained another big component: terrorists are the little guys trying to throw off some sort of oppression (real or perceived). This term largely stuck, and was later applied to organizations like the IRA, the Tamil Tigers, and so on. \n\nNow, I'm sure that many of the Bosnians considered Austria to be a terrorist organization just as you consider the U.S. military to be a terrorist organization. But I hope I at least opened your eyes to the fact that a word's denotative definition is not its sole source of meaning. Sometimes the connotative definition holds even more solid ground. The countries of the world *still* argue over what is and isn't considered terrorism, but the connotation really hasn't changed that much. It is rooted in a history stretching back over 100 years, and while there have always been people opposed to the thinking of the majority, the majority still rules as far as word connotation goes. \n\nSources:\n\nThe world cannot come up with a consistent denotative definition of terrorism, as exemplified by the varying definitions in terrorism legislation of different countries:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-terrorism_legislation\n\nThe origin of the term (make sure to look into the different sources posted here, both for accuracy and some interesting reads): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism\n\nAnd another http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_terrorism"

Feminists throw around phrases like \"patriarchy\" and \"male privilege\" all the time.  It makes it sound like they are claiming that all men got together one day and decided to systematically oppress women because men are all assholes.  I don't think that's the actual message that they are trying to communicate most of the time, but that's what it tends to come across as.\n\nIn comparison, the gay rights movement has branded itself really well.  Rather than blaming the establishment for their oppression, their message has been, \"Hey, we want to have certain rights and be treated as equals.  We're human beings just like you, and treating us as equals won't affect your life at all.\"  Maybe feminism will be an easier pill to swallow if you interpret it as a movement geared toward giving women equal respect, rather than a movement that makes men out to be the villain?",
    "rejected": "I think you misunderstand what feminism is. At it's core feminism is nothing more than believing men and women should be treated equally and fairly in society. I realise you said \"contemporary feminism\" but there is no difference. Yes the actions of the movement and it's focus has changed but the root purpose is still to attain equality between men and women, which is something we don't have yet. The reason why feminism seems redundant to many and we get complaints like \"why can't we just have equalists?\" is because the majority of people don't realise they are already feminists by default. If you believe men and women should receive equal pay for equal work and that they should each have a say on the government that rules over them, the clothes they wear and the people they marry then that makes you a feminist. Just as a goldfish doesn't need to label itself as a fish to be a fish because it just is, if you believe in gender equality you are a feminist whether you label yourself one or not. \n\nPhrases like \"contemporary feminism\" serve to diminish the problems men and women face today as being unimportant because they aren't as shocking as those men and women faced previously in History. Just because society has improved doesn't mean it's truly equal now. As much as we may joke about them, SJW catchphrases like rape culture, the patriarchy and sexism are all problems in our society today, and that's before we've even begun to look at the problems affecting women overseas.\n\n&gt;So I want feminism to be something I can get behind; but I can't do that in good conscience, with a movement that literally wants me, and all that I supposedly am, to cease to exist.\n\nSaying feminism is a threat because of some psycho #killallmen \"femenists\" is like saying democracy is a threat because of Nazis or that Jews are a threat because of Islamic fundamentalism. The movement is massive and anarchic, it has no leaders and instead relies on great men and women to guide it. You can't judge feminism over some whackos any more than you can judge the entirety of Abrahamic religions on the words of some crazies."

A parent can make many choices for their kid beyond what the law proscribes, and even into adulthood, family acceptance in general can have significant impact on happiness.\n\n Many parents have accepted their children's homosexuallity despite a religious background that tells them not to, because they believe that it's not just some sinful choice on the part of their child.

    "chosen": "I am going to start by echoing another comment: the logical conclusion of this line of thinking is to put a burka on every woman and/or exclude them from the workplace entirely. \n\nThat being said, the basis of your argument is false. \n\nYou and me both remember how distracting it was to go through puberty. Teenage girls are attractive. In fact, from the perspective of any hormone-plagued young man in the prime of his young lust, almost *every* teenage girl was nigh irresistible in high school. But my grades did not suffer for it. And any loose correlation between sexual attraction and bad work ethic is just a desperate excuse. The same is true for teachers. These are grown adults. \n\nHere is something else grown adults are capable of doing. Going to the beach. When I'm at the beach the only shelter between my privates and the passing onlookers is a flimsy pair of swimming trunks. An erection would be embarrassing, to say the least, but according to your logic, a boner would be compulsory nonetheless. After all, a lot of women on the beach are wearing even less cloth than I am. If I am a slave to physiological imperatives, why am I capable of doing anything when attractive women are around? \n\nI am not saying sexuality isn't a major aspect of human existence. But this notion that hot women are somehow \"distracting\" is exactly the kind of fetishism that arises in a country (I am from the USA, where prudish thinking is an epidemic) that tends to repress sexual feelings to the point that they become pressurized and warped. Telling women to cover up would only exacerbate this process of sustaining a societal nudity-fear/nudity-fetish. \n\nI hope my input was helpful and constructive.\n\n**Edit: I would also like to add that I DO NOT consider you a sexist for asking this question. You are merely promoting a sexist policy, but you are doing it in an attempt to be rational, not to put women down.**",

Because, the way you're talking about it is sort of the way most people address this concept, like it's some sort of transcendent sentiment, that there's a purpose that can exist forever and we're not a part of it and that eternal purpose is the only important thing.\n\nBut, I mean, that's just some feeling that we have, like envy or boredom. \"Meaning\" the concept as opposed to \"meaning\" the feeling, as far as I can see, has no need to be attached or correlated to some arbitrary concept like \"time.\"\n\nYou know when you're sorta YouTube surfing and you start on some silly video and later end up on a 2 hour documentary on some huge scientific conquest we've done in the last decade sometimes? Or sometimes, it's the opposite, but often, you'll watch a video about puppies playing patty cake with cats and then suddenly **here's all the physics ever.** (EDIT: So re-reading this, I realized that at this part, I accidentally did it in the same order twice so it's not the opposite at all but I'm sure reddit will forgive me just like they forgave that one guy who misspelled his name)\n\nOne of those videos I watched, I think, was about what's outside our observable universe. It started out with stuff outside of what we can see because of expansion, and that was like \"meh\" because it was mostly, as far as we can tell, just our stuff, same composition, pretty uniform except for some cold spot that could be evidence of a multiverse or something. And then they started talking about the multiverse. And how there are totally different temporal dimensions that our temporal dimension exists in and how our \"forward\" in time is \"up\" one level up or some crazy arbitrary dimension.\n\nLike, you just sorta realize that time is **totally and completely arbitrary.** People put so much emphasis on time being such a huge thing, like if we don't last until the end of the universe in 10^gazillion millennia or whatever they calculated it to be, we don't matter, but no, it's just another arbitrary dimension, it's like saying that unless I'm really, really fat, I don't matter and I'm totally meaningless because I don't take up as much space in this dimension.\n\n###So...\n___\n\nBeing dependent on time is so, so arbitrary. Time is just a randomass mechanic that our minds just sorta found it convenient to interpret. I mean, everything about our universe is just interpretations. These colors are just radiation. There's radiation going directly into my eyes right now and some physical law has allowed a mysterious thing called consciousness to emerge from the soup inside my head to make what we call an image out of that. Time is like color, we're just looking at entropy and somehow, the evidence of less entropic states enters each of our consicous states in order to make memories.\n\nMy take on this is if there is a meaning out there, you wouldn't know. Meaning, as far as I can define it, is ability to have some sort of effect. I'm not sure if logic even exists outside of our universe, like I don't know if true and false are just suddenly not the only states of things outside here, but as far as I can tell, the best definition is having an effect, and when you have rigorous laws and logic, everything you do affects everything. The universe is just a structure, time included, just like a bunch of blocks you put together to make a Jenga tower that relies on every piece to stay up except Jenga is literally the opposite of that, but everyone always uses it as a metaphor for engineering so w/e. That's what Chaos theory is, if you change anything or remove anyone, suddenly the universe doesn't exist. It's gone. If someone from outside the universe came in and made you not exist, literally the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is gone. Aliens outside of our observable universe but still in our universe would just, without even knowing why, also stop existing because they rely on your existence.\n\nThat's fucking crazy, like, right now, some pregnant alien overlord is worried about their leadership and their baby and they're not worried about me at all, but if it weren't for me RIGHT FUCKING NOW being a thing, they would be freaking DEAD. They don't even KNOW.\n\nI'm not even sure I'm trying to change your mind at this point, I started typing and then I just got really enthusiastic, but yeah, you really should realize that\n\n###TL;DR (Honestly, don't read the above, it's a ramble because I fucked up and I'm too lazy to fix it)\n\n\"not lasting forever means we're meaningless\" is so super duper arbitrary when you realize how non-unique and special time is. It's just, like, another thing. Like a burger. It's like saying if I don't always have everything to do with this burger, I am meaningless, from cow to slaughter to consumption. Why a burger? Why not a sandwich? Or a late night television show? At the very least, if we're meaningless, it's not because we won't last forever.",

In order to escape the fear of death we seek transcendence; we raise children or create art to effect the next generation. Example: the 'mid-life crises' is caused by 1) getting older 2) feeling you haven't influenced the next generation positively.

    "chosen": "I think there's an obvious philosophical argument to be had about the rights of women. It has been done better by other people. I'm going to make a point about public health. People want to control when they have kids. The primary reason why people have sex isn't to have kids. And if that comes up as a surprise it can be a terrifying shock. The choice to have an abortion often doesn't really feel like a choice in someone's panic. That's why when abortion was illegal people went great distances to get them. Doctor's would tell women to rinse with lye and soap vigorously. People used copper coat hangers. And women died. You do not want people doing complicated procedures like this at home with no supervision and training. So from a practical public health viewpoint, it has to be legal.\n\nLegally, it is even more complicated. Do you want women who receive abortions to receive life in prison? When abortion was illegal in Canada, a few doctors began doing the procedure and courts didn't know how to prosecute. It becomes even harder when you talk about spontaneous or life-saving abortions. Legal questions about abortions can result in women dying from pregnancy complications because abortion laws are not clear. That's unacceptable.\n\nThere's also the question of what life is. I really don't think a zygote is a human life any more than a sperm cell is. You may see this differently because of your background. But the legal and public health concerns are the practical reality that means abortion has to be legal. If this upsets you, I'd suggest not going to route of making abortion illegal. I would rather suggest that you support improving foster care, access to contraception, sexual education, and maternal support systems. If people are educated and supported, fewer abortions will happen and the quality of life for everyone will increase.",

If women don't get pregnant when they do not want children, then there would be no (or very few) abortions.

(hint, it's birth control and safe sex practices).\n\nBut what about in the case of rape or circumstances where the life of the mother is in danger? In these instances, I think most people would agree that abortion should be legal.\n\nPersonally, I hold the view that \"Abortion should be legal, but unnecessary\"\n\nSimply making abortions illegal will not stop abortions- just like making murders illegal doesn't stop murders from occuring. For one to actually stop an event from happening, one must analyze *why* it occurs and *what* can be done about it. Increasing exposure to contraceptives and lowering the cost of elective surgeries such thas the reversible polymer gel that shreds sperm that is injected into males or even more permanent options are excellent ways of curbing the amount of unwanted pregnancies. \n\nBecause in the end, if a woman needs an abortion to save her life, and it is illegal, then there will be significant complications that I leave up to your imagination."

    "chosen": "Among people who have never personally experienced a psychoactive state of altered perception, there is a pernicious and ubiquitous misconception about what such a state is actually like.\n\nThe subjective qualia of such a state is something so completely alien to the baseline reality you have become accustomed to your entire life, that... it really isn't possible to describe in words. It is something you have to experience to understand.\n\nAnd, in my opinion, if you are safe and responsible in where, how, why, and with whom you induce such a state, it can be an extraordinarily beneficial experience in your life.\n\nThe uninitiated - especially people with negative preconceptions about psychoactive states - tend to think that users engage in these states just to escape to a fantasy land of weird hallucinations completely detached from reality. Perhaps some people do it for those reasons (and there is nothing wrong with that either - fun is fun, and you have no right to dictate how other people choose to have their fun, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else).\n\nBut there are other reasons to seek these states. They can be profoundly enlightening, even spiritual experiences. Forget the specific content of a \"trip\" - simply *having* a trip, especially your first one, opens your mind to the mere possibility that there are *radically different ways to perceive and understand the world around you - perspectives that are wildly divergent from any you have ever considered before*. Drugs are not the only way to achieve such a realization, but they are a fast and effective way - and again, I don't see how it is your place to judge the method by which anyone else chooses to expand the parameters of their consciousness.\n\nAs for the self-harm and other negative consequences you mentioned, I think other people in this thread have covered that topic better than I could. What I will say is that I think you have a disproportionate idea of how harmful and/or permanent the side effects of drugs can be. And, of course, it really depends on the drug, the dose, the user, and the frequency of use, among other factors.\n\nMay I ask you a few questions, just out of curiosity? If I had to guess, I'd say you are probably in high school or college, and you've probably never tried any kind of mind-altering substance in your life (yet). Am I correct?\n\nI only ask because I held a view similar to your own when I was a straight-edge high school kid, many years ago. I was sanctimonious and judgmental about topics I actually knew very little about. I just had a gut feeling that people who needed to \"escape reality\" were inferior to us sober folks who faced reality head on. I later realized that what I perceived as \"reality\" was actually a very narrow, very singular vision of a much greater, more complex whole. And I doubt I would have realized just how narrow my vision had been if not for the help of mind-altering chemicals. \n\nI'm not saying the drugs taught me the \"truth\" about reality. What they taught me was that reality and truth have many different dimensions... and I was just a square in flatland, dogmatically proclaiming the infallibility of my 2 dimensional paradigm... until drugs came and lifted me up into a 3rd - not to show me anything in particular about the 3rd dimension - just to show me that *there was a 3rd at all*.",
    "rejected": "I think one of the ideas at the heart of your feelings is that the 'mind' is sacred and unchanging, except for when people use drugs, an that these drugs somehow contaminate the mind. If you prescribe to the scientific idea that the brain is the be-all end-all of the mind, (i.e. you don't believe in souls) then your 'mind' is really just applied biochemistry, constantly adjusting and correcting itself. Different neurotransmitters and other completely biological molecules change your mood, thought process, alertness, etc. constantly.Where I'm going with this is that ALL recreational drugs in some way change the action of naturally occurring molecules in your brain. But 'drugs' are not alone in doing this, your brain chemistry can depend on the content of your diet, including blood levels of salt and sugar, which are necessary for survival. So,\n* Your mind is constantly being tampered with and being changed by completely natural things and processes\n* This means that the effects of recreational drugs are just similar (although often more intense) processes that occur in the brain as a result of drug use\n* Since the line between drug and natural substance is so blurry, there is nothing inherently wrong with drugs or using them (they're not evil or unnatural)\nSo by these definitions, caffeine and sugar could be considered recreational drugs, considering we often use them to achieve a specific state of mind (alertness). Illicit recreational drugs are part of the same idea. \nAlso you can't call it 'harm' because that's a relative term. 'change' would be more appropriate and I would say that you overestimate the degree to which drug effects permanently affect the brain.\n\nTL,DR: Drugs are no less natural than anything else that changes or manipulates brain chemistry, such as sugar or coffee, and are not always harmful\n"

Because it's easier to throw up when you're really full rather than you're half full.\n\nHave you ever thought that the by purging you are, indeed, further developing your tendency towards \"overeating\"? Since, understandably, since you purge you will then CRAVE food?\n\nHonestly, I'm skeptical if you are actually healthy wieghtwise let alone not wieghtwise. If I had to guess, I'd imagine that you have body image problems of some sort. That's pretty common with individuals with ED. I mean, before you mentioned that you have a strict exercise regime in addition to your strict eating habits/bulimia tendencies. How can you be on a healthy path?\n\nWieght isn't every thing. People tend to worry more about people losing wieght. But guess what. When you do NOT recieve the right supplements of nutrients then your body cannot maintain it's metabolism. When it cannot maintain it's metabolism then that means that it cannot carry out fundamental biochemical reactions in the body that do (A) maintain + build neuron cells amongst a million other things. What does that mean? If you aren't afraid of the horrible effects of your \"bodily\" health you will probably be afraid of the fact that your brain will effectively be deteriorating. Your body has to undergo entirely different chemical pathways to support itself when it is not fed properly. When some one is in starvation, for example, they release a lot of ketone bodies in the blood stream which makes every thing more acidic. Why is that bad? Because your body is more or less built on working on a neutral pH (notice how water is the universal solvent in the body). But never mind your body, I guess I will touch more on the organ that others have dismissed. That is the brain. Ketone bodies can pass the blood-brain barrier. Do you know what prolonged exposure of those in your brain lead to? Coma. Death.

The idea is that for someone to believe in something there should be a compelling reason. I don't believe in the spaghetti monster because I've seen no one provide any evidence there is on. I don't believe in alien abductions because I have not seen any compelling evidence that they have taken place.

The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.

In terms of poly relationships, it's pretty simple. .. but I'll focus on A (our GF) and what she is to us. \n\nMy wife and I are a very close team.

Misunderstandings are rare,  because we talk exhaustively about everything under the sun. \n\nI get two partners that I love very much in my life.

    "prompt": "Communism can work. If it were not for Stalin and Liberal Reforms, the USSR would be successful",
    "chosen": "I have a problem with some of this stuff. First off, it ignores the communist revolts against the Vanguard Party. Yes, they declared that they were doing things on the behalf of the people, much like the French Revolutionaries before them. The problem is that people objected like in the Vendée or the Russian Peasant Armies they were met with violence. Lenin was complicit with launching coups against representative government and violent suppression of people seeking to protect their own interests. He did so while at the same time calling out labor union leaders for not recognizing that their own interests and objectives differed from those he led, never once realizing that the precise same dynamic was playing out with the Vanguard party and communism in general. Rather than coopting these other movements and incorporating the views of others they simply recreated a new autocratic political system modeled on Imperial Russia. This isn't uncommon in revolutions: when the English killed King Charles I they recreated first a military dictatorship and then reinstituted the Monarchy, when the French Revolted against the tyranny of their absolute monarchy they let absolute power fall into the hands of a small handful of radicals and eventually into the hands of one dictator. It turns out that autocratic and even tyrannical power is really, really useful for those who are in power. Lenin fell into a common trap. Instead of laying the groundwork to establish a stateless society he instead let the tyrannical tools and power of the old regime fall and be crushed by the people he immediately took it up and sought to use it to remake the world around him, just like the Czar before him and made the rise of a man like Stalin inevitable.\n\nIt's also important to note that many nations exploded in wealth and power. France, Germany, Belgium, and dozens of other nations were destroyed by a world War. Others such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, Hungary, and dozens of others were created from the corpses of those nations killed by that same war. Yet the 1920's was a time of remarkable growth across the board. The USSR wasn't even remarkable. It was only when the USSR was less impacted by the Great Depression that they bucked the trend, and that was largely because they were recovering slower and indeed lost to their neighbors in the prior decade.\n\nNo one here is arguing that Russia shouldn't have been a great power. They had been a great power for some time. But, the question here is whether or not Russia did great *because of* or *in spite of* their political and economic leadership.\n\nThere's a great deal of reason to suspect that it was *in spite of*. If you look at agricultural production you see some pretty serious losses in productivity with collectivization. This has been repeated time and time again. In the Soviet Union in the 20's and 30's. Again in the 50's in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. China's experiences with 5 year plans and the Great Leap Forward. Then again in the Socialist Ujaama villages in East Africa during the 70's. The mechanism being employed weren't just inferior to capitalistic production, but *inferior to the traditional production that preceded it*. The rejections of the value of local knowledge, the subordination of productivity to ideology, and fundamental flaws in Marxist Economics for no other reason that it failed to develop to accommodate new data because it was crushed under political orthodoxy that began with Lenin.\n\nIndustry was always the focus of Communist states. There were massive gains in this category, but that can arguably be a case of something being superior to nothing. You saw massive and impressive expansion of industry largely from scratch. Imperial Russia had functionally nothing. China less so. Both of these nations had demographics that made great power status inevitable but they were held back by backward and incompetent political leadership and economic structures. But even at their communist peaks Soviet products were always at a design disadvantage (especially for consumer goods), the incentives in the system were designed to promote an orthodoxy over productivity or quality, productivity was never equal to that of their rivals, and even when trade was possible you had things like Yugos trying to compete with Toyotas.\n\nCompare South Korea and Japan to the track of North Korea or Russia.\n\nMarx was a decent economist for his time, but you have to realize that the theory that he was working on was Ricardian. The premises he was working from were wrong.\n\nMonopolies are not inevitable, but there are some conditions that promote them. With the proper incentives they can be prevented from forming. Usually monopolies we see are those with massive barriers to entry, often times the regulatory burdens just compound the problems inherent in running wires the to compete with Comcast.\n\nOdd, because *some* planning has been successfully integrated into Capitalist economies, but systemic economic shortages is more often experienced by economies attempting centralized planning. *With perfect information* then a centrally planned economy *might* work out better *for the central authority* but long experience has demonstrated that putting that much power over capital in the hands of a small number of people ends badly.\n\nI doubt that horse unemployment is really a thing. You see, the primary cause of a lack of rising wages in the West is largely a function of those jobs moving to developing nations, and people in those nations moving into industrial or service industries from subsistence agriculture. It's less that technology is resulting in fewer jobs, but rather that people who were previously excluded from having any jobs at all are now being included for the first time.\n\nEmployers aren't the only ones who decide the wages. When they have all the market power they can approach it, but wages often rise over the objection of owners when the value of labor rises. More generally standards of living tend to be higher when people have more control over their own surroundings, rather than delegating that power to some third party.\n\nThe problem is that the political elite and economic elite aren't necessarily the same people in a capitalistic society. Whenever you have a vanguard party taking over that is absolutely the case.\n\nEverything is a ticking time bomb. As long as there is a structure that structure will collapse. Communism is a structure so whenever it is in place it would also be a ticking time bomb. The problem is that Capitalistic alternatives tend to both have *less* concentration of power and be *more* capable of adapting to challenges.\n\nCapitalism will eventually collapse because entropy. Eventually it will morph into a form that cannot survive or because people will just decide to try something else. The problem is that the problems that Marx identified didn't result in the collapse of Capitalism when it \"should\" have simply because the form of capitalism that existed adapted properly to meet those challenges. As long as Capitalism is made to work then it will continue to persist. Vanguard-led revolutions that don't allow themselves to decompose into something fluid and cede power to their own people are far too rigid and incapable of adapting and will always collapse first.\n\nTL;DR: The USSR was shackled by massive centralization of power and poor leadership.

While its development was certainly behind that of Western Europe and the US, it massively exceeded anything Marx had seen as he was writing down his philosophy.\n\nRussia only acquired it's reputation for backwardness and incompetence during WWI and the Russian Revolution itself, during which the economy rapidly collapsed.

Exports declined ~99%. \n\nFor more information on the Russian economy during this period: http://www.nber.org/chapters/c6021.pdf\n\n&gt;The USSR was trying to achieve development through an economic phase that SIMULATED capitalism, without the big disadvantage of losing control of the revolution, and maintaining a capitalist socioeconomic class structure. And you know what? It worked.\n\nThat just begs the question: Why not be capitalist instead of pretending to be capitalist?\n\n&gt;USSR went from a feudal society of field plowers to a superpower that launched satellites to spaaaaaace and could outfight and out manufacture the Nazis in a 40 year time span. It worked for them. Just not as they hoped.\n\nThe weakness of Russia in WWI was a temporary blip in an otherwise stellar military record. Germany FEARED Imperial Russia more than any other power in WWI because of their record (The Schlieffen plan basically considered France a temporary opponent and Russia the real opponent). They were on track to become the most powerful nation in Europe well before the Soviets were in charge.\n\n&gt;Inevitability of monopolies, which eliminate competition and gouge consumers and works.\n\nThis does not doom capitalism.\n\n&gt;Lack of centralized planning, which results in overproduction of some good and underproduction of others, encouraging economic crises such as inflation, slumps, depressions.\n\nIt's been proven beyond reasonable doubt that Centralized planning leads to overproduction, underproduction and economic crisis. This is because it has no method of determining what everyone wants. Meanwhile, markets with their prices not only gives an indication of what people want, but also incentives producers to match what people want. It is an amazing, automatic and oversightless way of ensuring that the goods society most wants are the goods that have highest production priority.\n\nThe Economic calculation problem is the nail in the coffin of communism being an economic competitor to capitalism.\n\n&gt;Demands for labor-saving machinery, which horse unemployment and a more hostile proletariat.\n\nhorse unemployment? What?\n\nLabour saving machinery is the only way to produce more than that of a pre-industrial society, where GDP hovers around $500 at most.\n\n&gt;Employers will tend to maximize profits by reducing labor expenses, thus creating a situation where workers will not have enough income to buy the goods produced, creating the contradiction of causing profits to fall.\n\nMarx's tendency of the rate of profits to fall has been thoroughly debunked by real-world evidence.\n\nhttp://www.advisorperspectives.com/newsletters11/images/11-4-fig1.gif\n\n&gt;And what about the coming of automation and the possibility of 40% of jobs being destroyed? \n\nWe've already done this twice. First to agriculture (where 99% of jobs were destroyed) and then to industry (where 70% of jobs were destroyed). There was no long-term increase in unemployment then.\n\n&gt;materials and goods can have better equality at more production, less costs\n\nHistorically, planned economies have produced absolute garbage quality goods for anything other than the military.\n\n&gt;and if worst comes to worst? \n\nBillions die. That's pretty bad."

There will be multiple companies in the future automating food production / delivery / sales. These companies will compete on price. As they both save costs by automating they will lower their prices (if you don't lower your prices no one will shop with you and you'll go out of business). Eventually this will drive the cost of food to almost zero. \n\nSimilar events will unfold in housing, clothing and other markets. \n\nOnce this happens it will be fairly easy for people to have their basic needs met at almost zero cost and the government will provide this for them (else they'll be riots, that's what happens when people get hungry). \n\nNow skilled labor in research and technology won't go away for a long, long time (at least until they invent real AI). There is literally infinite technology we can invent and create and almost infinite medical problems to solve.

    "prompt": "Love doesn't exist. CMV.",
    "chosen": "I have at least two arguments against your assertion that love is a cultural phenomenon: biology and universality.\n\nI'm specifically addressing romantic love, which is the result of deep bonding and sexual attraction. What you describe in your OP, as having attraction to women and wanting to have sex with them, is known as lust. Love emphasizes the **emotional bonding** between two individuals. It builds slowly over time and consequently has more permanence. Lust is **purely sexual** and is easier to both build up and diminish with a wider range of individuals. Romantic love can include lust, but it is encompasses more than lust.\n\nIf romantic love were purely a cultural phenomenon, then it would be neurochemically inseparable from lust. When a person says they love someone, then a brain scan should show the same chemical reaction as when a person says they are sexually attracted to someone. In reality, fMRI scans have conclusively proven that there are [stark differences](http://socialmediaandsexuality.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/brains-in-love-versus-brains-in-lust-an-fmri-study/) between love and lust.\n\nSecond, love is universal. Every culture on Earth, regardless of their societal norms regarding sex, has a concept of love that is far more than base sexual urges. This suggests that there is something about it that is hard-wired into us, and has been since we shared a common ancestor.\n\nI would also like to point out that the reasoning behind your argument makes no sense and is even contradictory.\n\n&gt;As society developed, and sexual taboos were set in place, we found loopholes - ways to get around the norms that sex wasn't okay.\n\nWhile its primary stages are the most intense, love tends to be long-lasting. If it were designed as an excuse to have sex, then it would diminish rapidly after the honeymoon period rather than lasting for years, decades, or for life. Being in love with one person would seem to reduce the chances of sleeping around with a bunch of people. Rather than being a facilitator of diverse sexual pursuit, it acts as prevention.\n\nIf you decide to respond, please include when you believe love was first invented. Any rough timeframe will suffice.",

I don't believe that idealized version of \"love\" exists either.  We're just happy being in the presence of one other.   All it is is a very deep attachment and complete mutual trust between two people who have experienced a lot together.\n\nWe're also both virgins.  We're not asexual, but... never got around to it.

They made cool stuff and gave it away for cheap, because Google's search engine made so much money that they could afford to try out random stuff.\n\nNow as the company is older, they had to start promoting those engineers to management positions, and not all of them took to their new roles very well. On top of that, Google started hiring a lot more consulting/banking business types. They are starting to expect returns on their investments on their fun stuff, and are finding ways to squeeze every dollar out of their ads. Finally, many of the truly creative developer types are leaving/have left to get involved with new start-ups. As a result, the culture has started to seriously decline.\n\nA good example is the recent fiasco with Youtube. In the guise of improving the site, they put in more ads, reduced the download speeds, and forced people to sign up for their failed Google+ product to register for the site. You can tell that those decisions were made by executive types rather than engineers that are truly trying to make the best experience for their users. This isn't really Google's fault. It happens to all companies. Remember that Microsoft was the most prestigious/profitable/innovative company in the world for a while too.\n\nSo Google is pretty good, but they are on the decline.

Based off of your search history, links you click, etc the results will be different.

Or is it self evident that massive objects distort space time which looks like gravity to us, per relativity?\n\n**Why macro-evolution isn't just a guess.**\nThere are many things that we can't directly observe that we can still understand.  I think a great example is looking at the walls of a very old building.

I just got an engagement and wedding ring and I dropped between 2 and 3 months of income on it.  Was it financially irresponsible?  Not in the least.

It can sometimes leave a bad taste, but often players writhe around on the floor in genuine pain (high impact collisions hurt like hell, but only for a few minutes), or just to have a quick rest, because soccer is one of the most physically demanding mainstream sports there is. \n\nYou mention Arjen Robben and the penalty that he won against Mexico, and give the reasoning that it wasn't intentional as why it shouldn't have been a penalty, but intent doesn't apply in this case. It was both a stupid and sloppy tackle to make by Marquez, and regardless of whether he does want to take Robben out or not, he makes contact with his foot which is enough to trip Arjen Robben over. Robben does make a bit of a meal of it, but it is the correct decision, because regardless of whether Robben attempts to stay on his feet but can't quite reach it, or he lies around on the ground pretending to be dead, it is still a foul in the box which constitutes a penalty.\n\nThe next point about how quickly things change in soccer is an entirely subjective point, and for many people is part of the appeal of soccer. Personally, I cannot enjoy watching Cricket or Baseball, because even if there is a major upset, it happens over many hours and you can see what is happening way before it does happen. This is not the case in soccer. For example, a team which is multiple divisions below another team (say Plymouth Argyle Vs. Man Utd) could meet in the cup, and despite Man Utd controlling the game for 90 minutes, a Plymouth Argyle 91st minute counter attack could turn the game from extra time and a probable Utd win, into a memorable victory for the minnows, something which is possible, but much less likely in other sports (including american football) due to how hard it is to prevent any team from scoring points. This type of fast paced excitement is partly what makes soccer the favoured sport of most of the world. Just watch the English Premier League title completely change hands in mere minutes, there is no other sport that can provide this much excitement on a regular basis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqgBONonE8\nThis video also shows the passion of the fans which is another thing that sets soccer apart from American football - i'm not saying that Broncos or Redskins or whatever fans aren't passionate, but they simply don't match up with the rivalries and the derbies in soccer (El Clasico, Arsenal Vs. Spurs, the Manchester derby, Brazil Vs. Argentina, the Turkish derbies especially, the Milan derby, the superclasico, the list could go on forever).\n\nPenalty shoot-outs are, again, very subjective. Bearing in mind that they are only used in cup competitions and the majority of matches are played in leagues (domestic competitions, e.g. MLS, Premier League; or international, e.g. World cup group stages, European championships qualifying), or with a two legged system which reduces the chance of a penalty shoot out. With this in mind penalty shoot outs should hardly be a big factor in your enjoyment of the sport, but also are exhilarating to watch anyway. Had Chile won the shoot out, you may be singing a different tune \"penalty shootouts are great, they allow smaller teams to cause huge upsets\", but even as an England fan I enjoy (perhaps not the right word, seeing as it's so tense) the tension of a shootout.\n\nIn terms of strategy, you're right Soccer isn't quite as tactical as American Football, but that isn't to say that it isn't a huge part of the game. There is a reason that the best managers are handed salaries that are into the tens of millions in some cases, and that reason is because tactics is such an integral part of the game. For instance, take Man Utd - the title winning team two seasons ago, Alex Ferguson retires, and essentially the same team comes 6th the year after, something which can only be explained by the change in management, no disastrous injuries, player losses, etc. Another good thing about the less tactics in soccer, is that they are less restrictive, it allows the talented players to improvise and pull ideas and chances out of nowhere, allowing the greatest players to flourish and providing excitement for the fans - e.g. James Rodriguez Vs. Uruguay, Lionel Messi Vs. Iran, Gareth Bale at Tottenham - all pulling moments of magic out of thin air, providing excitement and often leaving you in awe of their individual brilliance, rather than being shoehorned into a rigid system. However, tactics are often used in football to great effect - look at Atletico Madrid in La Liga this year, in terms of individual players they are far inferior to Barcelona and Real Madrid, but the rigid and structured manner in which they played, allowed them to win the league, which was extremely unexpected at the beginning of the season.\n\nThere is a huge variety in soccer, you just need to be more versed in the game than you are to see it. For instance, there are hundreds of different ways to pass a ball - a long diagonal crossfield pass, short tiki-taka passing, early crosses, drilled crosses, through balls, chipped through balls, and so on. There are also many different ways goals come about, and the variety in this is partly what makes the game so unpredictable and exciting - long shots, 1v1s, chips, headers from crosses, goals from corners, free kicks (direct and indirect), penalties, team play cutting open the defence, a fantastic dribble, own goals, defending mistakes, etc. Unlike American Football where very very rarely are points scored out of completely nowhere, it can happen in football which makes the game much more tense and exciting, and therefore more enjoyable.\n\nYou seem to contradict yourself, in your own point here:\n\n&gt; There's so much action! In football, an interception or a completed pass is exciting. In soccer, both of those things seem to happen every 5 - 10 seconds.\n\nIf American football is so action packed, then wouldn't it be American Football that has something going on every 5-10 seconds? In soccer the action never stops (as cheesy as that sounds), and anyone that watches soccer would realise that there is no need for many goals to make a match interesting, it is the back and forth action and the near misses that are much more exciting than a 6-0 rout. Watch the video i posted above for evidence, or the recent 2-1 win by Germany over Algeria, a game which was 0-0 for more than 90 minutes, but was an enthralling game.\n\nOverall, at the end of the day whether you prefer soccer or American football comes down to how you like your sports. They aren't similar in the same way baseball and cricket are, they are two very different games - one is high intensity, fast paced excitement, and the other is a tactical, (at times) slow paced battle of wits between coaches. Personally I find soccer to be infinitely more enjoyable due to the non-stop, fast paced nature of the game, in addition to the how one moment of individual magic can change an entire game, as well as the passion of the fans and players.",
    "rejected": "I'll take a stab at this because I'm a huge soccer fan and used to be a big football fan as well (having a TBI turned me off a bit, that's a different story).\n\nI think what it take to appreciate different sports is an understanding of the strategy. Football to the unitiated is just 22 guys running into each other, soccer is 22 players kicking a ball back and forth until it goes into a net, hockey is the same thing but the players hit eachother and have knives on their feet etc.\n\nWhen one learns more about the strategies of the game there's much more that meets the eye. In soccer one can learn much about formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 etc) styles of play (counter, possession) and watch for things like overlapping runs, wingers taking on defenders 1v1, beautiful through balls etc. It all comes from watching the game. \n\nNow, you say that any given play something can happen in football, and that's true. But 9 times out of 10 when the tailback runs up the middle, its going to be a 3yrd gain. I'm generalizing a little bit. \n\nIn soccer, I'd equate a run up the middle to a pass between a midfielder and a defender. 9/10 out of ten it recyles possession, maybe opens up the defence and if they cock it up they can turn the ball over in a dangerous position. Likewise a team can be attacking, battering the defense to pieces, getting chance after chance until a good clearance by a defender lands at the feet of his one teammate left up top as an outlet, who then splits the defense with a thrilling run and scores. \n\nThere are different skill sets for various players in soccer too. Wingers are typically pacy and good at crossing. Defenders have to be able to jump and tackling safely is a real skill. Xavi is one of the best midfielders in the world yet he couldn't play along the backline ever. \n\nWith regards to scoring, I think the difference is that there's only one way to score points, put the ball in the net. There's incredible drama when your team's been dominating for 90 min yet unable to put the game away due to a goalkeeper standing on their head. The agony of watching chance after chance fail is incredibly exciting because the next shot could be the one. \n\nShootouts and cheap fouls are a bit lame. With regards to the first, there needs to be some way of ending the game. The NFL has changed the rules recently but as of a few years ago it was the first team to score wins the game. Basically relying on the coin toss. In soccer the game is extended by 33% and only reverts to a shootout if it's still tied. Shootouts seem to be the only other answer because playing longer is dangerous to the players health.\n\nWith regards to cheap fouls and faking injuries, I do agree that that's a problem, sorta. In soccer, the game is at a much faster pace on average for the players. When someone's shoved to the ground at a sprint it can be dangerous for them and their muscles. Studs up challenges can and have ruined many knees. Naturally the goal is to protect the players. There are plenty of cheap calls in the NFL too. Pass interference is one that springs to my mind \n\nEmbelishment has become a problem because often the referee's do not award the foul if it doesn't result in the player falling down. That's just a limitation on how the referee is as a human being. That's not to say that faking injuries can't provide great drama. A team that's known for diving can be a great villian. \n\nWith regards to timing and what not, I like the shorter more focused time span and lack of commercials, but that's mostly personal preference\n\nUltimately I love the game because of what it's like being a supporter of a local team. 90 minutes in an atmosphere that surpasses all but the greatest collegiate sports atmospheres. If you live in the US try and get situated with the Free Beer Movement and check out a local soccer match near you"

To someone who believes, that is not something that should be hard to do. So the existence of hell is not as much of a negative in the mind of a believer as you are making it out to be because to them you can only end up in hell if you reject Jesus. So in a way you deserve it. More than even that, though, is that a belief in hell gives you the comfort of *knowing* that even if someone who does great evil in this life gets away without corporeal punishment, God will not let them get away without *any* punishment. \n\nAtheism, on the other hand, takes away all of that. To an atheist who does not believe in an afterlife everyone is equal in death. What you do in life has no greater meaning and when your life is over, it is truly ended. You, as the being you are with all of the life experiences you have had and all the joy you have experienced, are *gone*. Fearing dying is nothing in comparison to the realization that once you die you cease to exist. Completely. Oblivian. On top of that, if someone avoids corporeal punishment for their wrongs then they get away scott free.\n\nFor instance, Hitler died without facing any kind of judgement for his actions. For an atheist the only comfort is in knowing that he died. He is gone. So, however, are all of the people he killed. All of his victims who died in horrible pain after having their lives ruined, being starved, and in many cases tortured suffered a slow painful death but Hitler is said to have died by committing suicide. He died from a single gunshot wound to the head. In a way he got away with everything he did. For a Christian, however, he is in hell. They get the comfort of knowing that God is punishing the wrongs that Hitler did. \n\nSo I think that you are not considering all of the other kinds of comfort that are possible when you focus on comparing hell to nonexistence. When taken as a whole, Christianity, whether true or not, provides more comfort than atheism. That's part of its appeal and part of what makes giving it up so painful for so many people, even when they start questioning whether it is true or not.",
    "rejected": "Er, why is it less comforting just because there's an existence of hell? I would imagine the existence of heaven is really what makes Christianity comforting. If you're atheist, *everyone* just dies and ceases to exist. There is no hope for anyone. For most people, in that case, life is pretty pointless. If you're Christian, some people go to heaven, some people go to hell, but you yourself get to go to heaven. That in itself is very comforting; most people consider themselves the most important to them, after all. Even if some of your loved ones aren't Christian, that doesn't mean they will go to hell, they can just convert. That's why many Christians keep trying to get their friends or family to convert."

    "prompt": "I believe that pizza is a kind of sandwich. CMV.",
    "chosen": "A hot dog on a bun is *absolutely* a sandwich.  You'd have to be insane to not consider that a sandwich.  It's stuff inside bread.  How is that not a sandwich?\n\nBut when you get to pizza, tacos, and burritos, I think your categorization breaks down a bit.  First of all, I've had sandwiches that fall apart such that I have to eat them with fork and knife.  I pretty much always eat pizza with fork and knife, I don't care what Jon Stewart says.  Donald Trump is wrong about many things, but sometimes you just don't want to make a huge mess.  At least I don't eat sushi that way -- is sushi a sandwich too?  My mom eats sushi with a fork.  I find it disgusting.  Use chopsticks.  (Actually, I knew a guy who ate *pizza* with chopsticks, which is insane.)  Use your hands.  A fork?  Ridiculous.  Anyway.\n\nI think an open-faced sandwich isn't a sandwich.  It's bread with some stuff on it.  It's no more a sandwich than soup in a bread bowl, or bread dipped in truffle oil (that was lunch today, yummy).  To be a sandwich, stuff has to be *inside* bread, either in a split bun of some sort or between two pieces of bread.  In a pita sandwich, there are two pieces of bread that happen to be connected on the edges.  In a bun, there are two halves of the bread that are either connected on one edge or not.  A sandwich cross-section is always bread-stuff-bread.  In fact, \"sandwiched\" refers to something being between two other things, usually tightly.  You can have cracker sandwiches or cookie sandwiches, where you use crackers or cookies instead of bread.  You can have ice cream sandwiches.  But you absolutely need the layers.  If an open-faced sandwich is a sandwich, so is a pizza, but an open-faced sandwich is not a sandwich.\n\nNow, an open-faced sandwich *can* be a \"sandwich\", in quotes.  This is because it can share many characteristics with common *real* sandwiches that are known as such, and it can be treated like a sandwich even though it technically isn't one.\n\nBy the way, *not* sandwiches?  Pork buns.  Melon buns.  Taro buns.  Calzones.  Twinkies.  Dumplings.  Ravioli.  Anything that's bread with some filling *inside* isn't a sandwich.  It's a fine line between pita and calzones, it's true, and that has more to do with pita being honest-to-goodness bread than anything.  A pita sandwich is still stuff inside two slices, though.  A pork bun isn't.  It's got the wrong shape, and the filling is too 3D.  A proper sandwich has layers in hydrostatic equilibrium.  (Just kidding about that last part.)  There's a bottom layer of bread, and there are other layers until the top layer of also bread.  Sandwich making is an art, and sandwich toppings do not commute!  Woe to you if you put the cheese at the bottom, next to the bread!\n\nTacos and burritos are another story.  I would argue that a taco or a burrito is a \"tortilla sandwich\" but not actually a sandwich, just like sushi is a \"rice and seaweed sandwich\" but not actually a sandwich.  I want some sushi now, damn it.  But it's 4:30 AM, and it's cold outside so I don't feel like walking 5 minutes to the 24-hour supermarket to get some day-cold supermarket sushi...  Or do I?  ...I do not.  But are tacos and burritos sandwiches?  It depends on whether you call tortillas bread.  Same with moo shi, and that Vietnamese thing I had once where you soak the white sheets in warm water (the waitress had to show me; I had no idea that dish would be so much work).  I don't think tortillas are really bread, so they aren't really sandwiches, but they're sandwich-like, like ice cream sandwiches.\n\nPizza is only a sandwich if you fold it in half.",
    "rejected": "Personally, I'd only call stuff-between-two-pieces-of-bread a sandwich without any qualifiers.  I'd agree that a gyro or hot dog is a type of sandwich, but if someone asked me what I was eating and I was having a gyro, I wouldn't answer \"sandwich\".  The other issue I have with that list is hard-shell tacos.  I really don't think a hard shell counts as \"bread\".  I mean, it's not bread-y at all.\n\nBut a pizza is wildly different.  The main difference is that you put the stuff on, then bake the bread.  The bread part of the pizza never exists independently of the pizza itself.  You're not taking bread and putting stuff on it like a sandwich.  You have a pizza (just uncooked) before the bread has even been made.  That's the key point--you say it \"features some kind of bread and filling\".  But pizza dough covered in sauce and cheese isn't bread, it's dough.  The sandwiching happens before the bread is made, which makes it a totally separate thing.  Sandwiches are when you put some stuff on bread, not when you put some stuff on dough which is then made into bread.\n\nAdditionally, you called the stuff that goes on the sandwich \"filling\".  I agree.  Usually, in a sandwich, the bread holds or contains the rest of the sandwich, either by bracketing it (a roll), surrounding it (a wrap), or supporting it (an open-faced sandwich).  While pizza is close to the third, I don't think that it's really accurate to say that the bread supports the cheese and sauce--they're all baked together into one unit.\n\ntl;dr sandwiches are where you put stuff on bread.  but in a pizza, the stuff is put on dough and baked with it, which is unlike how a sandwich is made.  also, the cheese and sauce isn't \"filling\"."

    "chosen": "I'm a biker.  I haven't owned a car in over 25 years, and I have over 18 years experience in California doing a LOT of lane-splitting.\n\nIt is safer than the alternatives - by a lot.\n\nReason #1 is that we are far less likely to get slammed into from behind.  Between the cars makes more sense than front-and-back of 'em.  Cars can brake faster than we can, and cars often fixate on the car in front of 'em ignoring the bike in between.\n\nReason #2 is that it changes the way bikers drive.  California bikers ride the edges of lanes, because we know that escape routes exist around the cars in front of us.  California bikers get experience lane-splitting and then in an emergency we see escape routes that bikers from other states without lane-splitting don't have an instinctive feel for.  I moved out of California for work-related reasons in 2005 and I'm pissed that I'm slowly losing those instincts.\n\nThis tendency to hug the edges of lanes means I'm also not in the grease strip in the middle of lanes caused by car motors, trannies and differentials leaking.  There's less traction in the middle of the lanes as opposed to the edges where car tires keep the concrete scrubbed...esp. in the rain.  I see bikers in WA state, Arizona and now Alabama where I live proudly cruising dead center of their lanes and I just feel disgusted that the laws in these states prevent them from learning to be actual bikers.\n\nFinally, California bikers keep our bikes narrow, a habit I've retained.  They don't run big saddlebags or wide bars or the like - narrow is good for BOTH lane-splitting and emergencies.\n\nIn short, Cali bikers or others experienced in lane-splitting have different, more advanced skills.  We can fully and truly ride bikes the way that they're safe, using the ability to dodge as a substitute for the cage around the drivers of cages (cars).\n\nTake away that ability to practice dodging, which is what lane-splitting is, and you take away our most important ability to survive...and fuck you for thinking that's a good idea \"for our good\".",

They don't tend to be anywhere near as bad as getting pancaked between two cars would be.  I have seen a couple of lane-splitting accidents and was involved in one once - similar but in my case a lady pulled out in front of me and I braked too hard and fell over.  I was able to pick the bike up and finish my drive to work with minor pants damage...my laptop computer bungie-corded in the seat behind me even survived :).\n\nTL;DR: Lane-split accidents at reasonable speeds (see CHP guide I linked to) are usually \"owwie class\" as opposed to life-changing.\n"

    "chosen": "One of my ( to be attained) majors is also COMPSCI and I do agree with you to a degree. - you can teach yourself programming! Actually, you should spend some free time in doing just that, if you are passionate about computer science and wanting to work in the field. And yes, you can become a working programmer without having gone to university. But there are chance that you would miss out on some knowledge if you took that way.\n\nWhat the university is supposed to teach you is things many people have problems wrapping their heads around on their own. The logic and maths behind the programming. Not only that an algorithm works, but why and how it works. A better knowledge and understanding of time and space complexity. Those are things people who teach themselves programming often seem to not pay attention to, but which could come in handy.\n\nAnother thing university is good for is networking. Your professors often work on actual computer science projects, know people outside of university, etc. - you have four years to make a good impression, be noticed. This extends to your classmates, too. Being on good footing with people who might end up in the same industry, but still all over the country is helpful. A friend of mine is using networking perfectly. She is getting a summer scholarship and directly working with one of our professors now and I just know this is going to open so many doors to her.\n\nYou probably could do all of tjis, learning and net working on your own, you are right. You probably even could land yourself a job. But university makes sure you have the basic requirements needed, including those self taught people might overlook. - this is also why people will hire a person who went to university more readily than a self taught person.

The problem is, the most valuable things you learn from college are going to be the things that you probably wouldn't be able to teach yourself. An example: when I was a tutor at college, I heard complaints about the liberal arts education all the time. It was usually from math, science, computer science, etc, students who were really good at one thing: their major subject. They resented the fact that they had to take one or two writing classes in order to get their degree. The problem? The STEM folks who complained about liberal arts education were all terrible at writing. So bad, in fact, that they wouldn't be able to function in the workplace because their writing was incomprehensible. I had several math and science professors complain to me that their students didn't understand that there are so many other skills they need to learn in order to be successful: writing, teamwork, problem solving, awareness of basic facts about history, politics, etc.  It seems to me that the broad liberal arts education is designed with the idea that every student should graduate with basic skills and understanding in multiple areas so that they will be more flexible and successful. So, you may not need to go to college to learn the basics of botany, but any *botanist* will tell you that, to succeed in that career, you need at least an undergraduate degree and probably a masters or doctorate. Also, having been both a student and an instructor, I can tell you that academics don't think students are mindless plebeians. They didn't get into this business to simply reward and punish students for jumping through hoops, but if a student is only thinking about a class in terms of reward and punishment, and shows no interest in learning the material because the material is important or interesting, they won't expend energy trying to change your view. If you go into a class thinking the thing that matters is getting an A, and you don't care about the material, then you are the one putting yourself in a box.\n\nTL;DR: A liberal arts education is trying to take you out of the box you are already putting yourself in. Just teaching yourself the things that are easy for you to learn and ignoring the hard stuff isn't going to help you in the long run. Also, you may consider yourself \"smart\" now, but if you don't challenge yourself by stepping out of your box, you won't be able to keep up with the people who do."

Indeed, the underlying reason for the current situation is pretty simple: female sexuality is accorded value by society, while male sexuality is not.  That sexist double-standard creates a situation where sex is generally conceptualized as something women *give* and something men *get* (usually in return for something else).  Naturally, this lends itself to a situation where virtually all prostitutes are women, because (by and large) women have sexual capital to sell and men don't.\n\nBecause this all results from an underlying condition of gender inequality, your argument is actually circular: according to you, prostitution can't coexist with gender equality because of its gender asymmetry, yet that gender asymmetry only exists because of a lack of gender equality in the first place.

    "rejected": "Your story moved me and there are a few things I wish to say:\n\n1) Money is not equal to time at all. In fact, time is of nearly infinite value whereas money is something that comes and goes. A human being is in fact composed of time: by that I mean that it's the only resource you really have, and that once it's gone, it can never, ever be replenished. Everything you are only exists thanks to time. It is the thing that defines all others.\n\nTherefore experiences are much more valuable and pleasurable than material objects (in fact, this is scientifically proven). That is why a satisfying life can be built with few resources. You need to reconsider whether the experiences you are sacrificing today are worth uncertain material gains in the future. No matter how wealthy you are, there are things you cannot do as an old man.\n\n2) Time management is complex, because there are hidden costs. As you have experienced, working all the time has taken an extreme toll on your mind and body. It has also made you one-dimensional, which can be catastrophic if you want to have a fulfilling life. For example, sexual frustration can have a negative impact on your work in many unobservable ways. It's not simply a matter of linear progress after putting more time in a certain activity. You are not a robot. You risk the danger of burning out and letting all your work go to waste. For example, you could focus on reducing your expenses instead of increasing your earnings. It's all about calculations.\n\n3) The link between effort and money is tenuous at best. In most cases, social skills and luck are actually much more useful than technical skills when it comes to obtaining money. Take Steve Jobs, who managed to manipulate skilled engineers into building him a colossal fortune, without knowing any actual technical stuff. Maybe those kids you see socializing are busy building a web of connections that will serve them better than any degree. Hard work is important, but you have to make sure the energy you are expending is actually getting you towards your terminal goal. Remember the cliché, \"work smarter, not harder\"? There is a lot of wisdom contained in that little sentence. Capitalism rewards ideas and seizing opportunities, not genius. Even as a CTO, you are condemned to build the fortune of the shareholders, not your own. Your ability to become a CTO might also be compromised if your social skills and life experience are lacking. This applies to any leadership position.\n\nTake all this with a grain of salt. Maybe you'll end up hugely successful, who knows? It's true that I'd much rather have my son be a worker ant than a lazy cicada (a funny saying in my country). Society benefits hugely from people like you, but you may end up suffering as an individual. thanks for reading"

As far as pacing goes, both versions are slow and can drag outside the immediate action scenes. Look at the second movie, walking and talking to a short fight to walking and talking to a long fight. Adding the extra 40 minutes didn't significantly chance the pacing to me. It's still a long movie, I still care about the characters, and the fights are still cool.\n\nAs far as Peter Jackson's opinion, the opinion of the author or producers of a content doesn't dictate how it should be interpreted.

    "chosen": "&gt; * People that dedicate their lives to an external cause or purpose are satisfying extrinsically purposed goals.  People that dedicate their lives to their children are satisfying intrinsically purposed goals.\n\nI'm a wealthy, happily married, 35-year-old parent of a healthy and lovely 3-year-old, and I totally disagree with your viewpoint.\n\nWhat on earth makes our kids more \"intrinsic\" than other goals? The only goals you contrast parenthood with are (a) money and (b) celebrity; none of the child-free couples I know avoided kids for those reasons.\n\nI was married 12 years before I had my daughter. I used that time to pursue my own (graduate) education, to work in human services, to live abroad for six years, to travel the world, and to enjoy my relationship with my husband. These pursuits weren't shallow or immature; every one of them enriched my life and fulfilled my desire for a meaningful life.\n\nNow my life is more focused on my kid than on helping others and exploring the world, but I don't find my new goals to be any more \"intrinsic\" or in any way objectively worthier than my old goals and pursuits.\n\nOverall I'd actually say parenthood hasn't changed my ultimate goals much. I'd say my goal in life is to learn and experience as much of the world as I can, and to do what I can to make the world a better place. Trying to raise kids well is one way to try to make the world a better place, but the work I did overseas also made the world a better place. So having a kid didn't give me either new goals or a better way to meet existing goals.\n\n&gt; I am most interested to hear the reasoning of people who have stable careers and relationships who had mentally and physically sound children who regret the decision why.\n\nThere are days I'm happy I'm a parent, and there are days I regret having a kid. I miss my freedom. I miss travel. I miss spontaneity. You seem to think only unsuccessful or unstable people would regret kids, but it's precisely the fact that my life was so fulfilling and enjoyable beforehand that makes me miss it.\n\nIt sounds to me like having kids made you reexamine your priorities and realize your goals weren't worthy ones. That's fantastic. But then you leap to the conclusion that other childless people must also have unworthy goals, and that seems pretty groundless.",

When you raise a child successfully you are satisfying goals that are innate to your being. \n\nThis is some of the most ignorant shit that I've ever read. You're completely projecting your values onto someone else. What if guitar and the artful and skilled creation of music is someone's goal? Where do you get off supposing that having a child is *innate* to my being?\n\n&gt;And thus if you have children but these issues, it probably is not that your children don't make you happy, but rather circumstance or your personal issues which are making you ultimately unhappy. Not the act of having a child itself. Though a child could or probably does compound these issues.\n\nSeriously, read some stories of people who have these issues. Their children do not make them happy. Some of them wish their children would just hurry up and die.\n\n&gt;So when I meet people who say they don't want kids I assume they're either not ready, haven't yet realized that the goals they have in life externally imposed and not really important (a derogatory way to put this is that they're shallow or self centered, I prefer to state that they are immature. Since I made the same error and could only correct that error after obtaining my life goals and realizing the mistake in assuming these values from the system.)\n\nNo, when you meet people who say they don't want kids, you're speaking with people who actually accept the fact that a child might be completely disabled, that you might find you do not have the long term mental hardiness required to successfully raise a child, that a child could horribly destabilize your relationship and your entire life. \n\nYou're projecting your own feelings and experience onto the experience of other people. You say it right in your quote: \"Since I made the same error...\" \n\nIf kids are your intrinsic goal, cool, go for it. For me, *kids are an extrinsic goal*. Perhaps if I fell in love with a woman who was gung ho and I thought she would make a good mother, I would have a kid. But I don't want it. I guess I don't *not* want it, but the conditions whereby I end up with a child are so specific and coupled with my lack of inherent desire to meet those conditions, I don't see it happening. \n\nYou're speaking from this bubble world where everything works out perfectly. Sure, if I knew it wouldn't change a relationship, if I knew the kid would come out totally healthy, and I knew that I mentally had what it takes to commit the next few decades of my life to raising a family, then yeah, of course it would make me happier.

    "prompt": "I hate the fact I like fanfiction. CMV",
    "chosen": "Why ever would you feel fanfiction must be a guilty pleasure? Fanfiction is a well established part of literature dating back to when we first started putting stylus to clay tablets during Sumerian times and folks started riffing on creation myths. Much of modern Western literature evolved from the equivalent of fanfiction and some scholars would argue that Chinese literature is essentially nothing but. And some stories have simply become archetypes, spawning all manner of (effective) fanfiction: the Odyssey, Romeo and Juliet, Cinderella, the passion of Christ (which inspired the ending to Harry Potter, itself the most copied in fanfiction story extant), the Arthurian myths, Roland, Beowulf. Indeed, the Rapture myth itself is Biblical fanfiction, [invented by John Darby in the 1800s](http://www.bible.ca/rapture-origin-john-nelson-darby-1830ad.htm), and has literally nothing whatsoever to do with the teachings of Jesus. Nevertheless, legions of Fundamentalist Christians take this derivative fiction story to be the organizing tenet of their faith. \n\nMore practically, fanfiction serves a valuable function for novice writers; it provides a sandbox in develop their craft, receiving feedback from the fanfiction reader community. Most writers are readers and many readers (perhaps yourself at some point) become writers eventually. I see this as a good thing. I myself have written fanfiction as well as more traditional fiction, having published some twenty-odd stories of the latter (including a handful of professional sales). Without the experience writing and receiving critical feedback on my fanfiction stories, I probably would never have chanced it. (I certainly would not have had anything resembling the sort of commercial success without the experience.) \n\nLike anime/manga a decade or two ago in the West, fanfiction has become far more mainstream today. Vast sections of popular sites like TVTropes are devoted to fanfiction and far more people have at least been exposed to it, whereas even a decade ago mentioning you liked fanfiction entailed a long explanation of what it was (followed by people looking at you funny, wondering why you don't just read a book). Not so anymore. At my son's elementary school, all the kids read fanfiction along with regular fiction. It's not even a thing for them. \n\nEdit: typo",
    "rejected": "So, I like fan fiction too, but other than you I am not ashamed of it.\n\nHere are several things I like in fan fiction:\n\n1. Exploring different angles of the original story or exploring the world the story is set in: Most stories are written from one perspective, so exploring how characters on the side lines of the main events reacted to what happened around them is quite interesting. Same with exploring the motives of antagonists. Well written fan fiction can flesh out formerly flat characters, find possible explanations for why certain people acted a certain way and, all in all, can just be awesome character studies. \n\nIn a similar vain, most stories just focus in a certain time period and place the story plays in, but might name drop events in the story-world's history or places ( and possibly events) far away from the main action. Fan Fiction writers can run with that and just expand on the universe the original story plays in.\n\n2. Exploring \"what ifs\": A fan fiction can take an important point at the story's canon and try to imagine what would have happened if something went wrong ( or right) at this one point in \"history\". This creates alternative universes which can be just as fascinating as the original story. - I don't see anything shameful in that, after all we do that with real live, too. Alternative History is a thing.  \n\n3. Continuation: so, the original work in question has ended, but does that mean the world the characters came from just stopped? Probably not. The big battle is over and there might be an epilogue showing how everything is well somewhen down the line, but how did the characters get from \" after the battle\" to \" all was well\"? And, actually, how can ALL be well? It's impossible. What is happening after that epilogue? Where is that world heading to? I like the characters, the world so much but the author won't write anymore... So yeah, maybe somebody with a similarity good imagination to the author has some answers. - and I go and read fan fiction...\n\n4. Direct contact to the author: the author of the fan fiction, that is, not the author of the original work. I like that I can talk with somebody who created something interesting, that I can critique somebody's work and get an answer, that I might even be able to influence an ongoing work (this happened with \"real\" stories too, once upon a time, when many of them where published in instalments. Charles Dickens got influenced by reader's opinions several times, f.e.). I also just like being in a dialogue with somebody who likes something just as much as I do, so there's that. ;)\n\n---\n\nSo, why aren't I ashamed of liking fan fiction?\n\n1. Why should I be ashamed of liking something that is created to celebrate one of my favourite things? I don't feel like doing so is hurting the author and it keeps fans interested in the work over dry spells ( if the work is a long running series) of new canon and thus might lead to better sales come new canon, so it might actually help the author.\n\n2. I am not even ashamed of liking any \"wish fullfillment fan fiction\", because, well, again, it's not hurting anybody and it's not even RUDE to anybody, so I don't see anything bad with it. And maybe having an outlet for wish fullfillment like this makes me or some other reader or writer happier than otherwise, which I think can only lead to good things (friendlier attitude to other people around them, for example). - plus, nobody scoffs at people having day dreams, so why not like what amounts to written down day dreams?\n\n---\n\nNow, I'll be honest. I am a Fan Fiction *snob*! I scoff at stories that obviously never saw a beta reader; I complain about characters being out of character; I rage when OCs are dropped into the canon storyline with a flimsy explanation, just to end up snogging the main character within two chapters; I just sigh and close out of a fan fiction if it disregards major rules set up in canon ( let's say magic in canon always works that way and now this author makes magic work totally different, for example). But I do not see anything bad about liking the sort of fan fiction I reject either. Maybe somebody else is able to ignore bad grammar and spelling in favour of an interesting story, the more power to them! - I have to say I am puzzled when people love fan fiction where the main canon characters are majorly OOC, though, because, honestly, I read Fan Fiction about those characters because I liked their canon selves, so why would I a WANT them to be different?\n\nStill, I see nothing shameful with that, I just find it confusing.\n\n\n\n\n"

Culture leading to media is a simple law of supply and demand - the fact that there's a significant population with a conservative leaning and biases is what led to Fox News' inception. But that doesn't mean that those who work at Fox don't have their own leanings, biases, or agendas that they will consciously or unconsciously express in their coverage. With the exception of a few non-profits, essentially all media outlets have the primary agenda of making money, and even non-profits at least need donors and a steady viewer base to stay afloat. And given a media outlet's inherent credibility in its viewers' eyes (because if viewers didn't find it at all credible, they wouldn't watch it) and the sheer amount of exposure , their coverage and opinions tend to carry a fair amount of weight. Saying that the media doesn't influence people's opinions is essentially disregarding that 1) people working in media have no biases or agendas whatsoever, conscious or unconscious, and that 2) people are so firm in their opinions that constant, repeated exposure to an opinion won't sway their minds. \n\nNot to mention that a big part of successful advertising is the exploitation of people's fears. You might be a little insecure about your weight or body to begin with sure, but that doesn't mean advertisers won't jump all over that insecurity in an attempt to sell you a product.

Anorexia and eating disorders skyrocketed from nonexistent to dangerously problematic on the island in just a few years.\n\nTL;DR: True, people have pre-existing notions and feelings about things, which the media reflects.

    "prompt": "The U.S. government is completely untrustworthy and giving in more power is insane.",
    "chosen": "First, you said that \"this is true for all governments,\" meaning, I suppose, that you believe every government body is untrustworthy.  Since systems of government vary so wildly from country to country, from parliamentary democracies to theocracies to dictatorships, it can't be a specific form or kind of governance that you identify as the source of this problem, so that suggests you find a kind of illegitimacy in government by definition.  In other words, no government is capable of behaving in a way that you deem \"trustworthy\" because there is something inherently untrustworthy about the idea of government.\n\nIn order to address that concept, we have to agree about what sort of trustworthiness we're talking about, and since you repeatedly link the two, how this trustworthiness relates to the concept of government power.  It sounds to me like you are talking about the trust that a nation's citizens should be able to place in their government, which sounds reminiscent of the idea of the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) that supposedly exists between a government and the governed, a tacit agreement that citizens cede some power to a central authority in exchange for some benefits, such as national security, economic protection, and the general pursuit of the nation's interests above others.  Now, we can't argue here about some forms of the social contract being better or more legitimate than others--this isn't going to turn into a Hobbes vs. Rousseau debate--because you've already stated that you believe every government is \"untrustworthy,\" which I'm here parsing as \"unable or unwilling to fulfill its end of the social contract.\"   \n\nNow, I get the feeling that maybe this isn't so much about the social contract stuff at all.  As far as upholding its agreement to pursue its own citizens' interests above all others, it's arguable that the United States was doing just that even while committing the acts you've described.  This sounds more like a criticism of the opacity of our government--that sometimes it willfully misleads its citizens, that we're being manipulated, propagandized, and lied to by our government.  Here, I would concede that this is true, to some extent, of all governments: that sometimes, in order to maintain its legitimacy or increase popular support for what it feels to be the best course of action, every government uses \"spin\" to push forward certain agendas.  This is true both in modern democracies and in medieval feudal systems, because the government, if it wishes to last, needs its citizens to at least believe it is acting with real authority.  You might counter that, if the government needs people to trust its legitimacy, the best way to do that is to be entirely honest with them, and that's a great idea in theory, but in practice, a number of obstacles prevent this.  For one, different parts of the government need to have access to information that, in order to truly protect the interest of its citizens, must be held to the utmost secrecy.  The CIA can't let the media know every time it's started to hunt down a suspected espionage scheme, the FBI can't announce publicly that they're tracking the movements of a terrorist cell, the IRS can't broadcast that they suspect a large company has committed fraud before they have proof.  Certain vital functions of the government would cease to work entirely if forced to be transparent, and would in fact become counterproductive to the well-being of the nation.  It's true that these more covert aspects of government function can be used as a smokescreen by unscrupulous individuals or interests, but that's not *why* they exist.\n\nAnother scenario where obfuscation often arises is more in line with the events you mention as examples of government untrustworthiness.  Sometimes, the government needs popular support for a course of action it wants to pursue, but knows that the cause won't get that support on its own, so it manufactures a casus belli.  But why, in these cases, did the government's opinion of the best course of action diverge from the public's?  Often the problem is that the political framework of experts just doesn't translate to everyday people, who wouldn't accept the political reality of our world even when it is explained to them.  To use your WWI example, with hindsight it is easy to condemn the whole of WWI as a pointless, needlessly brutal war that never should have been fought, but imagine you're in the position of America after Europe has already entered into the war.  Now that many of your allies and trade interests are engaged in this conflict, it's going to affect you to one degree or another.  There are a huge range of motivations for American exceptionalism, from pacifism to xenophobia, but there are also motivations for entering the war.  One, it will improve the odds that the side your support actually succeeds, and it bolsters your relationship with your allies and to some extent, makes them indebted to you.  Two, it might hasten the end of the conflict, which could be considered a humanitarian win--even though your entering the fray will certainly result in some suffering and loss of life that otherwise would not have happened, it might mean less suffering and loss of life *overall*.  Three, war is generally good for the home economy, as it stimulates spending and development in many industries.  Also, at the time, there was a certain interest in both increasing US influence abroad and hopefully preventing future conflicts by starting an international peacekeeping force, which America could legitimately present only if they'd had a dog in the fight.  But these reasons are very big-picture, dry, and long-term, and everyday citizens often don't respond well to reasons like this.  They don't have the education or background, many times, to consider these arguments fairly.  What they respond to much more is overt patriotic overtures, emotional displays, and singular catalyzing events as the spurs for action.  This is why nations manufacture events like the Lusitania as a casus belli.  Also I should point out that your summary of that event is not in line with the link you provided--the conspiracy theory states that the **British** purposefully allowed the Germans to destroy the ship in order to bring the US into the war, but regardless, since the Lusitania sank in 1915 and the US didn't enter the war until 1917, its use as a rallying point for US engagement can still be seen as propagandizing rather than a legitimate primary motivation for the US entering the war.\n\nNow, we have to address what you mean by \"giving the government more power,\" but I'm going to break this into two parts because this has turned into a really long comment...",

So usually a bit older, but not too old.\n\nThe guys, on the other hand, will look for women around whom they can take on this confident and slightly dominant role. Guys tend to feel out of their element around women who outsmart them and out-achieve them, and tend not to be comfortable in a relationship like that.\n\nThis may not fit the \"progressive\" idea of a couple as two exact equals.

However, it is the fact that this confidence is unjustified - because there's no way in hell this guy can actually beat Mike Tyson - that also makes the statement an expression of arrogance. If we reversed the roles and had Mike Tyson say he could beat the amateur, this would be an expression of Mike Tyson's confidence in his abilities, but because he has all sorts of medals and belts to support his confidence, it is not an expression of arrogance.\n\nHowever, it would also be *arrogance* if Mike Tyson asserted that his *confidence* in his abilities -or his ability in itself- made him a superior person than the boxer, as boxing ability, success, fame, and wealth are all poor metrics to measure one's worth with.\n\nFurthermore it is *arrogant* to appear overly confident about one's abilities. If someone doesn't revise for a test because they feel confident in their intelligence and then failed it, they would have failed due to arrogance. Arrogance means different things to different people, but it is essentially the antithesis of being humble.

Simply knowing the correct answer is not enough, they have to prove that you DON'T know it, therefore making them bigger, better, more intelligent, etc. Their self worth and value is only in purposefully making you lower than them, by pointing out your flaws and their good qualities.\n\nWhereas: a confident person knows the correct answer, and that is good enough for them. There is a sense of \"humbleness and modesty\" that is tied in with simply being confident. After a test, they don't run over to you and ask what score you think you got just so they can say \"well I think I got a 100.\" \n\nSo if a person has low confidence, I think a truly confident person would be sensitive to that. Instead of using their low confidence to make themselves feel better, they would want to help the person and bring them up to their level of confidence, so they could share things more easily. \n\nIf you aren't an arrogant ass, there's nothing worse than rambling off your list of achievements to someone you know is doing worse than you. It just feels bad. If you are an arrogant ass, nothing feels better. \n\nAnother point then, I think confident people surround themselves with other confident people to create a healthy network of support, whereas arrogant people surround themselves by insecure people in order to make themselves feel better.

If someone stands trial for a crime and there's not *quite* enough evidence to make it obvious beyond reasonable doubt they are guilty, they'll have a not guilty verdict recieved- and that means if you rape someone, then hide the evidence well, you could feasibly not be found guilty of rape, then actually be able to force the (genuine) victim to prove they aren't lying, which would be fairly traumatic and a really strong disincentive to ever reporting sexual assualt when you don't have concrete evidence. As an example, OJ simpson was found not guilty of murder in criminal court, but then in a civil suit he was found guilty of manslaughter and forced to pay damages. The criminal court requires there be evidence beyond reasonable doubt whereas the civil court only requires  it's more likely than not that the crime was committed, so here even though the US justice system decided there was a &gt;50% chance he did it he was still found not guilty.\n\nIn Scot's law (IANAL but I'm pretty sure of this) there's an \"innocent\" verdict in addition to \"guilty\" and \"not guilty\"- you *might* be able to argue that in situations in which an innocent verdict were returned the accuser should face trial, but even then you're going to discourage the reporting of abuse on the off-chance the abuser prepares for it and fabricates some kind of alibi",
    "rejected": "One of the most important things to keep in mind in a court case is that the defendant is found either \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\", and not \"guilty\" or \"innocent\". The reason why this is important is that innocence implies that without a doubt, the defendant did not commit the crime he stands accused of. On the other hand, \"not guilty\" means that the court cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty. This is the law's way of saying that the defendant very well may have committed the crime, but there is not enough evidence to prove it. In the occasion of a \"my word versus yours\" case, such as the one you described, the court is **not** saying the accuser is lying, it is saying that there is not sufficient evidence for a conviction. To put the accuser on trial for perjury would be contradictory to the very nature of a \"not guilty\" verdict. Furthermore, don't you think people would be a whole lot more hesitant to report crimes if they knew they would be prosecuted simply because the defendant was found not guilty? The very reason why we do not put accusers on trial is so that no one has to fear the consequences of reporting a crime.\n   "

Their first elected government was [overthrown by a violent mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_August_\\(French_Revolution\\)) and [started a war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars) that would persist for a decade to come.

[Napoleon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) who was a dictatorial and warmongering emperor.\n\nThe American Revolution was followed by peace, the establishment of an actually elected government, and when problems did arise, a peaceful solution in the form of the Constitutional Convention.  The transition from Adams to Jefferson after the brutally contentious election of 1800 was probably the first peaceful transition of power between political adversaries in a sovereign state the world had seen for over a thousand years.\n\n&gt;and American Revolution was an overreaction to British enforcement of fair taxes that paid for the 7 Years War to protect Americans.\n\nIt was a mutual escalation, with colonial tax protests being met with [excessive reprisals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts) from the British crown.

First, most of the massive economic growth of the US took place after the Civil War, and were not primarily driven by slave labor at any point.  Second, the effects of that economic growth on human wellbeing across the country today are enormous.  Standards of living are very high in the US today, and there is no country on Earth which has industrialized without having poor labor market conditions in its early industrial period.\n\nAlso, immigrants to America in this era weren't dupes.  They moved here because America really did offer opportunity to make a life for yourself that wasn't available anywhere else in the world at the time.\n\n&gt;Civil War: The fact that it needed to happen and that a flag that represents those who fought to defend slavery is still being flown and celebrated is disappointing.\n\nObviously slavery is a dark mark on American history, and I have nothing to say in its defense, except that the north could have let the south secede, and a major reason that it did not play out that way was a moral opposition to slavery.\n\n&gt;World War 2: Significant military power, certainly helped turn the tide, still killed 300,000 civilians with atomic weapons and put Asian Americans in camps (with little reparation that came way too late).\n\nAgain, nothing to say in defense of internment, but will note that the US did not start WWII, and did not fully enter it until it was attacked by the Japanese and declared war on by the Germans.  War is nasty business though, and if you're looking for a war fought by ethical means, you'll never find one.\n\n&gt;Of course there are worse countries in the world, but current day America is a wreck. Frequent mass shootings that don't really happen in other developed countries, continued high race tensions, religious fundamentalism in the South and a poor education system. So tell me CMV, is there any reason to celebrate or be proud of my country?\n\nCurrent day America has problems, but we're not a wreck.  Crime is way down, our economic situation is doing much better than most other developed countries,  and we still have a reasonably functional government which allows for peaceful political discourse and meaningfully defends Americans' civil rights.\n\nIs it perfect?

That's different than saying that talking to strangers is never ok as a Christian.\n\nThe reason I point that out is that I think most people would agree with you that proselytizing to people outside a synagogue, or during a holocaust ceremony, is rude. There's no \"should be viewed as rude\" here - it is already.\n\nOther examples are more difficult - no one can tell that you are returning home for a funeral, for example. The right action in this instance is to back off and let a person in a sensitive spot take their time. The same thing applies with making a joke about cheating boyfriends in a conversation with someone that just got cheated on. It's not rude to make the joke, but it is rude not to apologize or give the person some space. Likewise, someone proselytizing should back off if someone is in a bad spot.\n\nNow to your original statement. My problem with it is that it suggests that a society is optimal when people don't talk with strangers. You don't want to be bothered by Christians, marketers, vegans, or or environmentalists, and that's fair, but opening a conversation with someone on the street, or in a bar, or wherever, should be socially acceptable. Full stop.\n\nIf someone doesn't want to talk, we should leave them alone, but I want the initial opener to be ok.

I can be a bad ass, a good looking rouge, a adventurous kid, a stealthy spy, a powerful brute, an armored knight, etc. I have a huge variety of characters I can play as. They're often depicted as being strong or intelligent or in control. They might face trials and have flaws, but they have character. They're dignified. \n\nWomen are much more limited. Very often when they are present they're treated as MacGuffin instead of people. They exist to move the story along for the main character, or to be eye candy. \n\nFor any single game or story, that's not a problem. Really, if a plot calls for a woman to be weak or sexy or to be captured to move the story along, it's fine! But our games do not exist in isolation. There is a pattern that emerges when you look at the whole of gaming. If we were in a society that was more equal, we would expect there to be about an equal number of men getting captured, being eye candy, or being plot points instead of people as there are women. But that's not what we see. We see over and over again that women are getting the short end of the stick. \n\nAnd it affects how people think and act. There is and always has been a symbiotic relationship between culture and media. What you create as a creative person (whether it be a game developer, a musician, a writer, or anything else) is going to enter the minds of people and affect what they think and how they act. Does that mean everything needs to be sanitized? No, it doesn't. But it does mean that you need to take care with what you say and how you say it. \n\n[Here's a post I saved for an occasion just like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1pzcqg/after_someone_said_i_couldnt_say_gay_jokes/cd7rpyp). When someone makes a gay joke without having any empathy for the struggles many gay people go through, they're not only alienating part of their audience, they're hurting that segment of their audience, and they're reinforcing people's negative ideas about gay people. That doesn't mean you can't ever make jokes involving gay people though! Gay people exist, we don't need to treat them special and put them on a pedestal and protect them. [I mean, here's a joke about gay people where being inferior due to being gay is not the punchline.](http://i.imgur.com/U3A6PV6.jpg)\n\nI used gay as an example there because I had the links handy, but you can substitute in any minority. Game of Thrones is a great series that is set in a very sexist world, but still manages to have a strong cast of developed and interesting female characters. The plot isn't driven by men doing manly things, it's driven forward by everyone, regardless of gender despite being set in a sexist time. Men and women can enjoy it because there are characters they can all identify with in some way and root for. I guess I fundamentally disagree that being sympathetic to minorities is the same as sanitizing things; GoT is anything but sanitized. \n\nYou don't see the problem because you're not faced with the issue of having to choose to play a game that doesn't allow you to play an avatar that represents you or some aspect of you in a dignified way. Women can be sexy. The new Lara Croft is sexy but dignified. Samus Aran ain't too bad looking herself. But it's one thing to have a sexy woman, it's another to have a sexy prop. \n\nYou should care about these things because there are people who are not like you who are not being well represented, and it pushes them away from the hobby and profession you presumably love.

    "rejected": "I'm going to boil down your post down to 2 main points:\n\n1 - You think it's okay to use stereotypes to create the basis for a character.\n\n2 - You don't think you need to worry about the minority of your audience.\n\nFor point 1, the problem isn't really stereotyping.  Yeah, stereotyping is bad, whatever.  The main thing is though, it just feels like cheap storytelling.  Your main character should be built from the ground up, not off a stereotype.  If the character *happens* to be black, fine, but if you go \"Well, it's a gang, so let's make them black\" before considering the character's, well, character then you're building a character off of something that's already broken.  Same goes for representing women.  The woman probably doesn't *need* to be represented as super sexy.  To represent her as such when her character wouldn't dress that way is just a cheap character build to get sales from teenage boys.  You *can* make sexy characters that are also strong, but it should be a part of their character.\n\nCompare the number of games out there with pointless but sexy guy characters to the number with pointless but sexy lady characters.  Clearly, there's some cheap character building going on with the women.\n\n\nAs for point 2.  You should include minorities in games for 2 reasons.  First off, it makes your fans happy. It's the same reason that TV shows and movies have minority characters. Most people don't mind, but it gives those minorities something to finally relate to in a main character.  It feels nice. The second reason is that it allows for more interesting story-telling. If your characters are all monochromatic, you lose a lot of potential drama and character growth.  For example, you could make a game about the civil war and have all-white troops, but then it would basically be CoD again. Add some black troops to the units, and it becomes much more interesting story-telling."

    "prompt": "I don't think Islam is problematic.",
    "chosen": "You've *way* oversimplified. First, you need to define what boundaries you are putting around what counts or doesn't count as being \"Islam\" or \"cause related to Islam\", or a \"problem of Islam\". I think you are equivocating a lot around that concept.\n\nFor example, do we abstract out levels to generalizations or leave it as specifics. If, for instance, instability and backwardness of the region is largely a result *of* Islam, particularly the fighting between factions of Islam as well as between Muslims and non-Muslims in the region, does that count as being a \"problem of Islam\", or is that a problem of religion in general, or of innate tribalist (in-group, out-group) tendencies? One might say it is all of these things. Except that not all tribalist tendencies result in this type of situation and not all religious disputes result in it either. But sometimes it does. Does any of that matter here since we are, in fact, talking about Islam only here. Sure, we could argue about some hypothetical other religion in the region causing similar problems, but that hypothetical world *is not this world*. In this world, it is Islam that is the problem in that region. And indeed it is Islam that led to much of the problems in that region. Much of it used to be far more advanced, with men and women more free before more fundamentalist Muslims collectively gained power.\n\nBy your reasoning, we can explain away just about everything. There was nothing wrong with Naziism then, because all it did was exploit existing Lutheran antisemitism in the region that led to the Holocaust. Had Naziism not done it, some other belief system would have, so let's stop blaming the Nazis. As you've even stated, \"Political, social, and economic disorder breed radicalism (see: post-WWI Germany)\". Therefore, Naziism isn't a problem either. How is that any different?\n\nTo be of explanatory value, you need both causal relationship and predictive power of unique features leading to that relationship. For example, Hitler's parents having sex had a causal relationship to the Holocaust but it has no predictive value. We can't know somebody had sex and predict it could lead to a holocaust. We can, however, look at Mein Kampf and predict that this sort of thinking, in power, could be very harmful.\n\nThe same is true of Islam. If you actually read the Koran and see how people in the region interpret it, you *can* predict the harm it will cause. Sure, it's not guaranteed. And it isn't the *only* thing to consider.\n\nBut let's turn the question around the other way. Imagine two cases; In Case 1, everybody agrees with you that Islam is not problematic. In Case 2, you change your view and everybody agree that Islam is problematic. Now other than those words written on the page, what real-world, practical difference does it make in what you or anybody does? Keep in mind we still have the Islam-based terrorism you agree to in both cases, including first-world radicalized Muslims. What does inserting the word \"not\" mean in practical terms. If it's just all an abstract concept, then this is all just meaningless academic masturbation.\n\nFor me, the practical difference is whether there is value in promoting secularism as a cure for the ills of the region, that religion is a source of their ills, that religion is, in fact, wrong, and in efforts to show people of the region that their *specific* beliefs are what lead to this harm; that Islam at the current time is particularly prone to radicalization. To convince a rational person to do something evil requires convincing reasons on why it is somehow a good thing; to convince a religious person you merely need to convince them that their god wants it. Certainly fundamentalism of some religions is a problem, but even moderates set the stage for fundamentalism as enablers; they extol the values of the koolaid, which the fundamentalists then drink.\n\nSo is it tribalism? Yes. Is it religion? Yes. Is it Islam? Yes. And tribalism is just the natural selection result of game theory economics of groups fighting over limited resources. So we can blame nature and economics too. Where does the buck stop?\n\n",
    "rejected": "&gt;Up until the mid-20th century, Islam was widely regarded as one of the most peaceful and tolerant religions out there. And if the Middle East were traditionally a Christian-dominated area, and the West traditionally Muslim, there would probably be people right now beheading journalists in the name of Jesus.\n\nI'm going to disagree with you here.  While Christians have done some pretty terrible things in the past, no Christian denomination has the concept of \"Jihad\" as is common in Islamic thought.  There are no verses that say \"Fight in the way of Jesus\", and whether or not the verses themselves are misinterpreted, those verses can be found easily in the Qu'ran.  There are no traditions in Christianity that depict Jesus or the apostles fighting, beheading, or maiming people.  In fact, if anything, it's quite the opposite.  there are stories of the apostles *healing* people, perhaps preaching.  There are martyrdom stories -- in which people are tortured and killed for being Christians.  In those stories, the apostles were never violent, and quite often offered very little resistance to their tormentors.  Paul was thrown into prison many times.  One time there was an earthquake, and Paul *stayed in prison* rather than run.  \n\nThe two approaches to conflict are not the same and will not produce the same result.  A man who reads in his holy book \"Slay the infidel\" is going to approach conflict differently than someone who reads \"Resist not evil\" or \"Vengence is mine, I will repay, says the LORD\".  The second man is being commanded specifically to *not fight back*.  When your heros are doing things like chopping off the opposite hands and feet of an entire tribe of people (quayresh tribe of Jews), that sets a different model than seeing your heros in the faith heal others, submit to torture without violence and retribution.

Wikipedia has a [whole article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial) describing the climate denial phenomenon as \"a set of organized attempts to downplay, deny or dismiss the scientific consensus on the extent of global warming, its significance, and its connection to human behavior, especially for commercial or ideological reasons.\" As the intro to the article notes:\n\n&gt; Between 2002 and 2010, conservative billionaires secretly donated nearly $120 million (£77 million) to more than 100 organizations seeking to cast doubt on the science behind climate change.\n\nThe conservative retort I usually hear to this is that liberals have a vested interest in regulating everything, so the science can't be trusted, which I think is moronic. You can argue that liberals are too quick to use government to solve social problems, but usually there is at least some purpose to the purported overreach - like giving poor people food, or making sure everybody has healthcare. Simply arguing that the expansion of government is the end in and of itself of liberalism is a thoughtless position that conservatives are forced to take to justify the fossil fuel industry spending massive amounts of money to try and paint climate change as \"unsettled\" science.\n\n*Edit - [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1egihs/i_dont_believe_that_global_climate_change_is/ca03ehj) is another great comment making a similar point from an earlier thread on this topic.*",

There is a scientific consensus around global warming being a serious threat to the survival of the human race, and the latest UN report concludes with I think 95% certainty that it's being caused by human activity. They aren't just making those numbers up - the UN doesn't go to politically biased left-wing sources to put together its reports. It dispassionately compiles evidence from the best expert sources and conducts its own research according to strict evidentiary criteria.\n\nThe Christian Republican capitalists you're talking about likely lack technical training. In the UK, one of the most prominent climate change deniers is a man called James Delingpole, whose professional training is in journalism, and he is a self-confessed scientific illiterate (he says that reading peer-reviewed journals is unnecessary). The problem is that global warming is a very technical scientific question, and unless one has the technical training necessary to evaluate the evidence and come to a conclusion based upon expertise, then it's all just noise.\n\nThat doesn't mean that laymen like you or me can't have an opinion on global warming, but it is important to be able to evaluate sources. The problem, as evidenced by your contention that anthropogenic global warming is a matter of controversy, is that a lot of very wealthy individuals have managed to successfully turn climate change into a political issue. In the highly polarised US, that means that there is one \"side\" that agrees and one that disagrees. The establishment media tries to cover it straight down the middle, as if it were merely a question of party politics. It isn't. It's a question of pure science - and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that global warming is real, and it's caused by humans. \n\nIt's like the whole creationism vs. evolution nonsense. Yeah, you can go on Answers in Genesis and find explanations for all these observable phenomena in evolution, or listen to a Kent Hovind lecture and have it explained to you that carbon dating is unreliable, but these are highly unreliable sources that are a) unscientific and b) highly interested in politicising a scientific issue for dogmatic religious reasons. Similarly, with climate change - what should really be a question of evidence-based public policy has, because of massive amounts of corporate interest, become an issue of party politics."

    "prompt": "I've never had one sip of alcohol, and I don't have any interest in ever trying it. CMV, please!",
    "chosen": "The dirty secret about alcohol is that it actually really does feel good.  Nobody starts down the road to alcoholism because they like throwing up or blacking out.  So let's at least first make that clear - the first few drinks of any drinking session *are enjoyable*.\n\nYour main reason for not drinking is out of fear.  And that's OK, it's good to acknowledge when you're scared of something.  You don't want to end up not being able to stop when it's fun and get to a bad place.  Nobody wants to end up sick, unconscious or as an alcoholic.\n\nBut you do want to have fun, you want to be able to go out and be social and enjoy yourself.  So really what you need to do is be sure -- absolutely fucking sure -- you can stop.  So I have two suggestions.\n\n*****\n\nSuggestion the first:\n\n**Note:** This suggestion presumes your girlfriend and her friends are not big fucking assholes.  If you think they're the kind of people who will want to laugh at you while you drink the most noxious thing ever, skip to Suggestion the Second.\n\nYou and your girlfriend get together to throw a Mulch's One Drink party.  You commit to having exactly and only one drink.  All attendees know this in advance.  This is your first drink, so that's damn exciting! Here's where it's fun for the attendees: You let them (as a group) pick out your One Drink.  Put it up to popular vote, and then you drink whatever the winner votes for.  Since your girlfriend and her friends are fun responsible people, they should *want* you to have one enjoyable drink, to ease you in.  After you take the big sip, then you enjoy your one drink slowly and you make sure your girlfriend and her friends know -- you're only having the One Drink.\n\nAt the end of the night you've tried a single drink, and you know that you actually *can* stop at just one.  Going forward, if it ever stops being fun, **stop drinking**.  You already have seen you can stop, so just use that willpower in the future.\n\n*****\n\nSuggestion the Second:\n\nList out some flavors you tend to like here, and I (and anybody else knowledgeable) will make a few cocktail suggestions (I promise, I will only suggest things eminently drinkable and well enjoyed by many people).  Pick your single cocktail beforehand.  For your birthday, you and your girlfriend go out to a fancy restaurant.  She orders whatever she would like and you order that single cocktail with your dinner.  Do not order a second cocktail.  Enjoy your dinner, go home afterwards.\n\nThe thing is, one drink really won't get you that drunk^1, and it won't get you drunk enough so that you are too inebriated to stop yourself.  That level does vary from person to person (and the only way to find out is to not have fun) - but that's ok we don't really need to know what your tolerance is.\n\nYour goal here is to be social.  With a single drink in your hand, you can be social.  If you've got a beer in your hand, you can take small sips for a really long fucking time and nobody will give a shit.  And the people that are going to pressure you to get more and more drunk you really want to **run the fuck away from them**. They are no good, at all.  You don't want to hang with them.  However, they really are in the minority once you leave college.  At a work function or hanging out with a few close friends if you nurse a single beer for 3 hours . . . nobody is going to mind.  You're there, you're having fun, nobody is making anybody feel bad, and it's all good.\n\n*****\n\nTL;DR: Set yourself up publicly to only have one drink the first time.  Stick to having one drink and you won't lose control of yourself, and won't ever reach the bad stages you're describing.\n\nCaveat: I feel obligated to say this: Your reasons are the best reasons to not partake.  If you find the first time you can't stop at just one, don't ever have that one again, and don't ever feel bad for it for a fucking second.\n\n[1] Unless you're like a 75 pound girl.",
    "rejected": "&gt;I have never tried a sip of alcohol, and have no interest in doing so, because of an abusive alcoholic father, long lines of alcoholism/addictive personalities in both sides of my family, expenses\n\nThese are all very good reasons to be wary of alcohol, and honestly I'm not sure I would recommend you ever start drinking. That having been said, as someone who didn't drink until they were 21 and had a healthy fear of alcohol, these points:\n\n&gt;bad taste, and because I don't believe that it gives you anything that you can't get while being sober.\n\nAre pretty universally thought of as false. Alcoholic drinks are generally an acquired taste, and I don't mean \"they suck but you get drunk\", I mean that over time you will dislike or tolerate them at first, but end up liking them. You could think of them similarly to things like broccoli or asparagus, where many people dislike them at first but grow to like them.\n\nThe second one is even more obviously false, one of the major things you get when drinking that you don't while sober is lowered inhibitions and (usually) more social confidence. There is a reason that a \"buzz\" is mentioned by those who drink, because your body does get a pleasurable feeling from being at a certain level of intoxication. You mention these yourself, but saying things like:\n\n&gt;But I can have lowered inhibitions and be happier and friendlier myself, simply by just not giving a fuck.\n\ndon't make them true. You can certainly become as happy/friendly/uninhibited as you want without alcohol, but it does have effects that differ from what being sober is.\n\nNeither of these are, in my view, things you **have** to have, and if you have a history of alcoholism I would be very careful. \n\n&gt;I want my view to be changed, because I'm tired of being an outcast. I have not met a single person in my life who has ever felt the same way as me. Even the smartest, brightest, and most charismatic people, will still go out and drink on occasion.\n\nThis is untrue, there are and have been many people who have not drank for a variety of reasons. Yours is actually the most common: Fear of alcoholism. Unfortunately for most of your peers this is not something they have experienced first hand (lacking abusive alcoholics in their family) and so they will not be able to empathize with you especially well.\n\n&gt; I just can't ever seem to get over myself.\n\nThis is crazy, you shouldn't be forced to \"get over\" maybe becoming an alcoholic. If you do choose to drink in your future I would strive to alert those around (friends/family) to the possibility and to prepare them to help you if it becomes a problem. \n\n&gt;Also, my girlfriend really enjoys drinking (especially beer/wine tastings), and her friends do too. So any time they want to go drink, it's immediately a conflict of interest for her, and I don't want our relationship to be strained because of me. She has been VERY supportive and understanding and encouraging, and I love that so much. But if it's something that she really enjoys doing, and it's something that brings her closer to her friends, then I don't want to be left out of it. And I don't want her (or them) to feel guilty or anything like that.\n\nTo be blunt: This may become an issue, and if you never drink you may or may not be able to be with someone who does regularly. You should mostly think of it like a hobby that they all share and enjoy, which you do not. Is you not sharing that hobby with them too much a social issue? It may be, but that just means that you two aren't right together.\n\n&gt;I'm painfully closed-minded, but I'm working on it.\n\nYou are not close minded, you are scared. There is a big difference. I was very worried that when I started drinking at 21 I would lose control of myself and do things that were, well, crazy. I've been pretty lucky that I haven't had this issue. \n\n&gt; Is there any hope for me? What are your thoughts on this?\n\nThere is hope for you, both that you could introduce alcohol slowly and be safe and not an alcoholic, and there is hope that you decide not to ever drink, and you own this decision and make it clear to others that it is not up for negotiation. My thoughts on this are to proceed carefully, but not to think that anything you are doing or going through is either unusual or rash."

Therefore, I don't understand why so many people like it, or I do not think it deserves the praise it gets.\"\n\nPeople who are not professional critics can certainly have valid criticisms about film that are not dependent on their enjoyment. I understand and agree with the sentiment that one should examine art more critically than simply \"like\" and \"dislike\". However, basing judgement purely on the consensus of professional thought doesn't encourage this, it merely appeals to authority. Critics are not always in agreement, the opinion on artwork changes over time: one could certainly find a current critic's darling overrated, and consensus may agree with me them in a decade. \n\nFor example, John Updike was widely celebrated as great novelist during his lifetime, yet more recent critics have found him to be [lacking](http://www.themillions.com/2013/10/metronomic-virtuosity-on-the-collected-stories-of-john-updike.html). One reading him during his heyday could have found the same issues as current critics do, and yet they would (according to your metric) be unjustified in their judgement until enough critics shared the same viewpoint.\n\nOne of the major issues that the modern establishment has with Updike is his narcissistic, misogynist viewpoint and yet you'll note the linked article only quotes male critics from any generation. I don't believe one needs to be a woman to note this issues in his writing, however, it does speak to another point: critics are not a perfect representation of the populous. The critical establishment has been very white, male, and upper-class for a long time, and celebrated and promoted authors of a similar mindset. Film critics skew Western. While this doesn't invalidate their opinions, it means the critical consensus is often based on the perspectives of a small-subset of the the population. Thus novelists artists like Updike are often hailed as great American novelists, when their perspective is as narrow and singularly focused as the authors who get labeled as great \"African-American novelists\" or \"women authors\", and so forth. Examining the perspective of the critics themselves is as important as examining their views. ",
    "rejected": "&gt;generally when people say something is \"overrated,\" they mean, \"this is critically acclaimed or appreciated by a huge number of people, but I don't like it. Therefore, I don't understand why so many people like it, or I do not think it deserves the praise it gets.\"\n\nThis is perhaps a little unfair.  Certainly many people do mean \"I like it\" when they say something is great or \"I don't like it\" when they say something is bad or terrible.  But as you point out, the terms can mean something much more germane than that.  When a thoughtful critic says he enjoyed a movie, he is not saying the same thing as when he calls it great.\n\nJust so, many people do in fact merely mean that they didn't like a movie when they call it overrated. But many others use it correctly - they do mean that they've looked at its merit (I don't know that I want to get into the issue of what criteria should be used) and believe others are making a mistake when they rate it highly.\n\nIn short, I don't think it's reasonable to assume that people calling something \"overrated\"/\"underrated\" are any more likely to be lazy than people calling something \"bad\", great\", or any other judgment.  If anything, I think the people calling something overrated/underrated are less likely to be lazy.  They have at least gone to the trouble of learning what others say about the issue.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't look at movie reviews so often as product reviews.  When I see product reviews calling something overrated or underrated, my experience is that the person making the review has done more research than the average reviewer."

    "chosen": "I think you're correct for the most part, but still believe I can change your view a bit due to adding an emotional component you may not be considering due to inexperience with some situations. I want to note I don't think this inexperience makes you a bad person or an idiot, it's just data you may not have to put into consideration. While speaking about causation can be beneficial in a vacuum, there is an overall context that may make it harmful, and when and how you discuss it can lead to it being potentially more damaging than helpful.\n\nWhen I entered my friend's room after they called me about being assaulted, I found them sobbing and repeating to themself \"I'm so stupid.\" They had invited someone they didn't know very well into their room - something just about everyone I've known has done multiple times - and, in this case, it turned out for the worst.\n\nIf someone had come in and said to my friend, \"well, inviting someone into your room is a risky thing to do,\" then I wouldn't be frustrated with that person because they were wrong, I would be frustrated with them because they were being emotionally inconsiderate. Yes, there were logical decisions on my friend's part that put them at risk, but my friend is already dealing with emotionally damaging self-blaming and self-loathing, and this just throws fuel on the fire. When someone is unable to leave a room for 3 weeks because of waking up in the middle of the night sobbing and having flashbacks, you pointing out how they could have lessened their chance of this occurring is not on the top of the list of things that need to be addressed. Later, when that person is speaking with a trusted therapist who can unwind causality from self-blame, is a more appropriate context to discuss the the issue with that person.\n\nI'd equate it to walking up to someone whose dog was hit by a car and saying, \"dog-chains will keep the dog away from the street and make it less likely to be hit by a car.\" You're not logically wrong, but you're not really helping. By pointing out the causality to the owner - who is likely already blaming themself - you're likely hurting them more than your information is worth. In addition, you're not fully informed; for all you know, the owner's last dog strangled itself on its chain, and he just put in a fence that the new dog dug under. This is why there are commenters in this thread who are saying people are being unempathetic; they're not seeing the emotional context of the event, and just focusing on the logical context - considering the causality in a vacuum instead of as part of a whole incident. Again, this is not because they're stupid, but because they likely have never had a full context on an issue like this before.\n\nThis is not to say that conversations shouldn't be had about dangerous areas, or that people shouldn't be warned about dangerous activities; those things lead to better-informed citizens and better policing, as well as other endeavors such as improved lighting for areas that are high-crime. However, there needs to be a question of when and with whom that conversation should be had; in cases like sexual assualt, I think the causation argument should be had with the therapist. People who see it on the news and say it, especially without the full context, are potentially doing more damage to the person than they are helping, without realizing it.",

The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.\"\n\nDo you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim's decisions. \n\nThe first just says it's all Mary's fault. \n\nIt's a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn't know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?\n\nDoes the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those *in a better way*?\n\nIt's *assumed* that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn't. It's a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. \n\nThe world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like \"she shouldn't have been there\" we are exactly saying \"This would never happen to me because I would never do that\" and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.\n\nWhen we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don't talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don't talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThings got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.\n\n#1. The point of all these examples was this: \"Causation\" can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it's human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging. \n\n#2. How does this relate to OP's topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you're probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you're discussing the situation that happened, you're discussing causation. \n\n#3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It's perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It's not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.\n\n#4. I wasn't trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don't feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime."

I don’t even need a prescription for alcohol or cigarettes, and those are things have been proven to be bad for you and/or a danger to your health.\n\nCiting WHO?  Of course the WHO recommends breast feeding.  So does every doctor.  So does every parent.  Everyone does, because that is what breasts are for and you can make a real good argument that that is what is best for the baby.\n\nHonestly, I could make a similar argument for why we should force parents to use cloth diapers vs. disposable.

I can see from your posts overall that you're interested in minimizing risk and maximizing profit, which is a typical and sensible position for a business owner to have.

If you've managed to go this long with a company this large without having any under 50 women, I imagine you work in logistics, construction, engineering, or something similar - not in, for instance, education, where women dominate the talent pool.

So your heuristic (don't hire women of childbearing age) seems to be okay on the surface.\n\nLet's say your current employees fall on a one-dimensional talent distribution as a sample of the larger available employment pool, and further let's assume the talent of the workers is normalized. In order for it to make sense for you to hire women of childbearing age, you'd have to stand to make more profit from hiring them than you'd lose by having them go on maternity leave. \n\nIf the difference in productivity between your most productive worker and your least productive worker is a factor of 2, meaning that two workers at opposite ends of the distribution at the same point in their career will make you $50,000 and $100,000, respectively, then you should be able to shed some dead weight and replace those people with people from the existing labor market who would be willing to jump ship to your company for the same price you were willing to pay their predecessors. (I know, there is a huge amount of handwaving here, but I can generate numbers if it'd help.)\n\nIf you consider that people's talent and their desired wage are somewhat independent, and that people will trade non-financial factors for wages (time off to take care of family, for instance, might be worth $10,000/annum to someone), then you should be able to see that you ought to be able to find the same productivity as your upper-half performers for less than you currently do on the existing labor market.\n\nWe still haven't addressed the issue of the cost of maternity, though. Well, again, if you make the assumption that you lose one year per five from women of childbearing age (birth, maternity leave, doctor's visits, sick children, etc), then for a given talent distribution you should be able to trade them 20% of their salary for non-salary benefits (flexible scheduling, work at home opportunities) and still come out even with where you are now.\n\nGiven that you're not currently hiring from this talent pool, I would suggest that your company is hurt by not having women.",
    "rejected": "* You are sacrificing potential long-term workers for those of an age that will only work for a determined amount of time (depending on what the age is they have to leave in your country). Your argument could be that, yes, I do that, but I hire men instead of women. The thing is that you're not doing that. You do still hire women above 50. Age comes with a lot of risks too, in fact, where I am there is more likely to be discrimination against age because it's 1. More expensive and 2. Health risks. \n\n* You look at it in gender-wide risks. You see men and women of equal capabilities, and draw a picture that portrays it as if the only gender-specific risk is pregnancy and sexual harassment. First of all there's a problem in removing the victim out of the equation when it comes to sexual harassment. What would you say if I had a company that refused to hire men on the basis that it's a risk they will sexually harass my female employees? You're (figuratively) punishing potential female workers on the basis of something they can't even control, instead of looking towards the actual, and factual, controllable factor. \n\n* I also find it alarming that you're using such exaggarations in portraying your problem. It is not 2 years. It is less. And it's even a less amount that is paid leave. You hire a woman who works for you for the rest of her career. Let's say she starts at the age of 25 and then continues on to at least her 65th. That's 40 years minus the average amount of kids and the paid leave that it would require. You end up with only a little less than 40 (around 39 I guess?). And yet you would hire a woman above 50 that will, by these calculations stay for a mere 15 years + health risks. \n\nYou are sacrificing stability out of a fear of taking a risk, that is not in my eyes an actual risk. What you have is a petty problem over something that, in the bigger pictures, is not that big of a difference. You overlook the fact that men and women are different in ways other than pregancy/not-pregancy and have avoided the opportunity of a varied, stable and strong workforce all for the sake of what is a minor problem in long run. \n\nI think it's obvious that this is not a logistic problems, however logical you may find it, but rather a moral one. And one, I suspect, you are very stubborn in holding on to because the way you work now, I have no doubts, probably does work. But you have never seen the other options and haven't ever tried it. You are preventatively avoiding problems that you have no experience in having, and seem to not have researched properly."

    "prompt": "I believe that pure capitalism, though not perfect, is the best economic system for a nation. CMV",
    "chosen": "&gt; I believe that because these businesses would be for profit then they would work much more efficiently and for a fair price (supply and demand would dictate this)\n\nTwo things. Firstly, this implies that you will only ever need products and services where you are in a position to choose freely from a range of providers. There are plenty of situations in real life where this is not possible (due to monopolies, emergency situation or infrastructure constraints, for example) - but this has largely already been addressed by other posters.\n\nThe second thing, which I haven't seen mentioned yet, is your choice of the word \"efficient\". \"Efficiency\" is a term that many free market advocates love to throw around, but it's actually a very fuzzy one. How do you measure \"efficiency\"?\n\nIn pure, unregulated free-market capitalism, the answer is simple. The sole criterium of an enterprise's success is whether it makes its owner money or not. People who believe that the free market inherently does a better job of satisfying people's needs therefore usually derive their logic like this: Higher customer satisfaction means more customers, and more customers means more money. Therefore, it is in the interest of private enterprise to aim for maximum customer satisfaction.\n\nThis logic isn't inherently flawed - in real life, things frequently do work out like this. But they also frequently don't. For the sake of argument, let's assume you live in a somewhat remote community with a reasonably low population. Let's assume that due to this, the roads in your community are not very profitable for their operator. It could easily be more beneficial for the operator's bottom line to just let your town's road network crumble and rot rather than investing in them. After all, the inhabitants aren't going to stop using roads altogether, even if they are of poor quality, so they are going to keep paying.\n\nLet's modify that example somewhat and assume that this community is served by a public railway line connecting it to the next large city. (Probably not the most lifelike example for the US due to the high percentage of car ownership, but a realistic scenario for other countries.) The line is served regularly, making it easy and convenient for the community's inhabitants to commute to the city every day. This brings money into the community and makes it a reasonably attractive place to live for families and urban professionals, which in turn is beneficial for the community's local businesses and shops.\n\nLet's now presume that the railway company is suddenly privatised, and the new owner realises that this particular line, while being important to that community, is not actually financially profitable. The line gets closed down, making the community much less convenient to get to from the city, thereby basically making it more remote. Over the following years, most of the commuters move elsewhere, local business suffers due to decreased demand, and local shops close. The standard of living declines, and everybody loses - except for the railway company's new private owner.\n\nThis is \"efficiency\" in action. The owner doesn't care that the line's existence had a beneficial effect on the local community, and improved the health of the local economy as a whole by creating more emplyoment and business opportunities. Why should he care? It wasn't making him rich, therefore it was not efficient.\n\nThis is my main issue with the purported \"efficiency\" of pure capitalism: It would be measured in a very short-sighted way. We are all human beings, with human needs, human souls and a limited time on this earth to enjoy. We are all so much more than the pawns of someone's economic theory - and yet, this is precisely what this definition of \"efficiency\" makes us.\n\nTake public parks, for example. Don't know about you, but I love 'em, and in my hometown (in Europe, for context) they're definitely a boon to social and public life. Doesn't matter if you're a hobo or a billionaire, doesn't matter if you're a stoned student or a single mum with three kids, doesn't matter if you want to kick a football around or meet your friends for a barbecue, doesn't matter if you want to go for a run or just have a nap under a tree, doesn't matter if you want to meet friends or be on your own for a while: They're available for you, open 24/7, and free. They're green, lush and lovely.\n\nThey're also woefully inefficient - the upkeep costs the taxpayers money, after all, and shockingly, nobody is getting rich off the whole thing! Why not just tear the parks down and replace them with privately owned parking lots? Problem solved! Efficiency prevails!\n\nTo sum up my point: Human needs, human existance and human society are inherently very complex things. The sort of \"efficiency\" free-market capitalism purports to deliver is a gross oversimplification of real life circumstances that makes for a very poor yardstick when it comes to judging whether something is worthwhile or not. A worthwhile life and a functioning society involve a whole range of factors and things that can not be directly measured in dollar amounts. The free market can't be trusted to preverse them, or even not to attack them.\n\nI'm sure Philipp Morris would find it \"more economically efficient\" if they were allowed to distribute cigarettes to kindergardeners, given the chance. They'd probably even be right. That doesn't make it a good idea, though.\n\nEDIT: typos and formatting",
    "rejected": "To start out, you seem to be referring to free-market or liberal capitalism, if you ever want to be clear about what you are referring to.\n\nMarkets are unsuited to a whole host of tasks due to the constraints of the physical world and general human decency put on the ability for a competetive market to function. Let's take your example of road construction for a spin on this.\n\nRoad systems are dynamic, complicated things where changes in one place have a significant impact on function elsewhere. The experience of urban planners has been that when they widen a road in one place to relieve congestion, it often creates or intensifies congestion elsewhere in the system. A free market in road construction would have people building roads to increase throughput in one place and not being responsible for the problems it causes other road users elsewhere. Attempts at forcing firms to be accountable for these problems (called externalities) would result in complicated layers of regulation, the very inefficiencies you are opposed to in your position.\n\nThe construction delays your are experiencing are not necessarily the result of government inefficiency, either. Most road construction is performed by contractors who are supposed to participate in a competitive bidding process not dissimilar from what a private enterprise would. Delays in road construction can come from a variety of sources, such as a materials subcontractor (private enterprise) failing to deliver on schedule, mechanical breakage, unexpected cost overruns, or funding disruptions. Many of these problems are squarely in the control of the private contractors and the ones that are not are still very familiar to anyone who works in construction for private interests. Ultimately, it is slow because taxpayers respond more to cost and quality than they do to timeliness, so that is what is sacrificed.\n\nYour belief that supply and demand dictate a fair price presumes that there are rational actors working in a competitive market, which is frequently not the case. You aren't going to have competition in water and sewage service because the economic cost of installing and maintaining two sets of pipes which can reach homes is unreasonable. You aren't going to have competition for emergency medical care because people are largely unable to make decisions about which hospital gives the better value when they are losing blood all over the back of the ambulance.\n\nThe list of ways that markets fail is tremendous and most of the work in economics for at least the past half century has gone into describing in tremendous detail exactly how it fails and ways that it might be improved upon. Are markets tools which can be leveraged for a lot of good? Absolutely, but they are simply tools, and flawed ones as well. Sometimes markets are not the best tool for the job and, luckily, we don't have to use just one tool."

The 60's-80's had their fair share of crappy, mediocre artists interested only in profit as well, but guess what?

Not like today's commercial crap\".\n\nIt's the same with any artistic medium. The classics survive, the commercial dross is forgotten. Do you think Twilight will be studied in 50 years time like the works of Orwell are? Do you think Transformers will have the sort of fan-base Blade Runner does? **The reason why you think that older music - music before your time - is better is that it's easier for you to find great older music, because the bands from 50 years ago that are still remembered today are the ones that have stood the test of time.** Searching for good music in the present is much more tricky - not because there's less of it (because arguably there's actually far, far more), but because you don't get the convenient filter of 'music that has had lasting impact' and thus you have to wade through all the fads of the moment that the general public lap up in order to find the good stuff.\n\nMy advice?

    "chosen": "Obviously, it's going to be hard to counter the 9/10 you cite.  Certainly my own experience shows it to be a significant, but far lower percentage.\n\nBut let me tackle a few of these.\n\n**Crackers, salt, sugar, sticky things over the table or on the floor**\nA large number of your points cover these.\n\nIn theory, most restaurants wipe down the table between guests.  Whether it's the breadcrumbs I've left, or stuff that fell of my plate, there is usually some debris (and even if there isn't, I'm hoping you're still going to wipe down the table).  For most items, really, how much harder is it pick up some extra salt?  If I brought my own wet wipes, you'd need to throw them away, which is probably as much work as making an extra pass with your washrag.\n\nAs for stuff like, say, syrup or ketchup that spills, some of that is inevitable for a kid eating.  I'm not talking about purposely letting them draw on the table in ketchup and mustard, but normal kid eating.  Assuming your restaurant had a kid's menu, the expectation was that they'd be serving kids, and a reasonable amount of sticky is just part of the package that your management decided was worth dealing with to get parents through the door.\n\nTo put it another way, I don't bring wet wipes with me when I eat in a restaurant, even if there's a chance that I'll drop a pat of butter, or that a ketchup-covered fry might fall off my plate.  I consider that part of the expected service.\n\nAnd as another poster mentioned, most restaurants don't want customers getting up to grab a rag or a sweeper to do it themselves.\n\n**Running around the restaurant**\nAbsolutely not cool if the parents know it's happening.  But at some point, kids need to learn to self regulate.  There were times when my kids were younger that they wanted to go the to bathroom.  I'd tell them to walk, and watch them on the way there, but, being kids, by the time they were finished, they completely forgot about the walking.  If I caught them running, I'd scold them, but sometimes they'd forget.  \n\nI know it seems obnoxious to inflict them upon others as a learning opportunity, but, honestly, there aren't a lot of other situations I can think of where this same skill is studied.  In most public places, you don't want to leave your kid unattended at all.  At home it doesn't apply.  A restaurant is a public-but-closed environment.\n\n**Crying**\nOk, this sucks.  I can tell you that as much as it sucks to hear someone else's baby, it's worse if it's your own.  You don't get used to it - you get to be embarrassed by the public humiliation, guilty that you can't fix what's wrong, and as frustrated as everyone else that there's a baby crying.  \n\nI don't in any way support just letting a baby cry and cry in a restaurant.    Usually when I've seen it, the parent is desperately trying to shut the kid up - giving them a bottle, rocking them, feeding them (messy) crackers - anything.  Many parents will try to take them to the waiting area if there's room.  \n\nBut you are in a tough space.  You just ordered all this food, and what do you do if you can't shut the kid up?  Wait outside (if the weather lets you) while the rest of your family eats?  All you wanted was a decent meal that you didn't have to make.  \n\nAgain, I'm not excusing it, just explaining it.  You have no idea how much the parent is just hoping, HOPING that the kid will settle down so they can eat.  So, they may keep trying longer than they should, out of near desperation.\n\nNow, there are parents who are complete selfish assholes.  But most are just doing the best they can.",

You are a **server** and your job is to **serve** the needs of customers. People go to a restaurant so they do not have to cook or do dishes. Some people are messier than others, but they shouldn't be responsible for cleaning up after themselves.\n\nI won't make more of a mess than usual, but I'm not going to pick cracker pieces off of a disgusting restaurant floor. The effort for me to clean it up is much greater than the effort for you to sweep for 10 seconds.\n\n&gt; It was just with their child that they stopped being considerate. They weren't sloppy and rude themselves, but they don't teach any of this to their child.\n\nThat's the thing about children; there is always a stage where they cause trouble in public. Some parents are more in control than others. \n\n&gt; For most of the parents, I would assume that if they were at a friend's house, they wouldn't let kids do these things.\n\nYou wouldn't do this at a friend's house, because you aren't paying the friend to cook for you and clean up afterwards.\n\n&gt; My view right now is that these parents just see servers as less important than they are, and therefore are not deserving of any kind of respect or consideration.\n\nWhile you certainly deserve respect and consideration, your needs are absolutely less important than that of your customer.

I can list them if you like but I don't even have to, you can think of enough on your own.\n\nIndeed. The murder of the Charlie Hebdo journalists was a horrible attempt at censoring the freedom of expression through terrorism.

Soon the upskirt photos were banned in Massachussets closing the loophole http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/07/justice/massachusetts-upskirt-bill/\n\nTake the Trayvon Martin shootings. An unarmed black male was shot and killed by a neighborhood watchman. Many will disagree what happened, but under florida law Mr. Zimmermans actions were LEGAL. That doesn't make them MORAL. Do I know what happened that night? No. The only two people that truly know is Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Martin and one of them is dead and the other could very well be lying about it. \n\nThe law is not there for judges or juries to morally judge. Everyone has different standards of morals. Some say gay marriage is immoral, some say porn and booze is, but as we've seen with court decisions even southern red states are overturning gay marriage bans.\n\nMorally, I agree with you, but legally these teachers broke the law knowingly. whether it be the right thing to do or the wrong thing that's for people to decide, but they still broke the law and they need to be punished for it.

I'd like to know. But it's all in the definition. So my opinion on abortion came from asking \"For a moment, let's say they are persons. Let's even say zygotes are persons!\" From a pro-choice standpoint, this is the worst case scenario, yes? We'll grant the pro-life movement that every fertilized egg is in fact a full person, just like you and me.\n\nEven then, I am pro-choice because I do not think we have a responsibility to other people that goes nearly that far. We do not require people to donate organs, or even blood (which has sooo much less consequence than pregnancy for a much shorter time). Not even to their own children. We do not require people to help others even if they are able. If you want to throw away your food and let someone starve, legally, you can. We may not LIKE this behavior. We may think it is rather awful, even. But we don't want to make it ILLEGAL, because we respect the rights of people to do what they want with their property. We ought to do at least as much for our bodies, which are literally US. \n\nBasically, I think that the question of personhood is actually not one we need to answer in this debate, because no person can hang out inside you, using your organs, causing you substantial discomfort and the potential of death, for 9 months. We wouldn't make anyone sign up for that to save anyone else, not even their child. So why would we do it in the case of pregnancy?\n\nIf your answer is \"they signed up for it cus sex,\" did you sign up for the car accident because you drove? What if you were going over the speed limit? Did you consent to all possible consequences of driving? Maybe, but we still try to save your life when you crash. We do this even for people who are engaging in quite dangerous behavior. Taking a risk (having sex, particularly in the case of having sex with protection) does not mean you signed up for the worst outcome. You know it may happen, but you aren't signing up for it any more than you are signing up for a car accident on your way to work.\n\nWe'll ignore the fact, for now, that in the case of rape no consent was ever given at all.\n\nThis is why I think abortion should be legal, even if I don't like it very much.",

How many hours are you spending to finish them? I think you'd be hard pressed to find an activity that will give you as much entertainment hours per dollar spent than a book, unless of course you're buying first print classics for thousands of dollars.\n\n&gt;they're free at libraries anyways\n\nWhy not take advantage of the free library books then instead of piracy?\n\n&gt;why spend the money on something I'm going to toss the next time I move?\n\nYou definitely shouldn't, unless you're getting something more out of the books than just 30 hours worth of diversion. That's a choice though you'll have to make at the end of the book. \"Was this good enough to justify me putting it in a box and moving it with me when my lease is up?\"\n\n&gt;convince me that buying books is helping authors in a substantial way.\n\nYou need to know something about how books get published. It's a troublesome process for the author. They write a manuscript and if they're smart, they pay an editor to help them refine the book. This costs a non-trivial amount of money that the author pays out of pocket.\n\nNext the author must present the edited manuscript to a publisher. This process is facilitated sometimes by an agent who will help negotiate the royalty figures that the author will receive. If the publisher thinks the book will do well, then they'll agree to produce a batch of books. I'm not sure where the minimum is, but they don't just print a million copies and hope it sells. They print probably like 10-15k first run hardbacks in your average case and they watch how well they sell. ***this is the point in the process where your piracy really has the potential to fuck over the author***. If there is not enough collective interest in a book because 10k people decide they can't be bothered to pack up a book when it's time to move, so they pirate, then the publisher will see only 5k of this author's books selling. They'll decide not to do a second run and the author will have maybe a little income from a book that, had piracy not happened, might have actually done well. \n\nYou see, in publishing, there's sort of a critical mass that a novel needs to hit before it can start snowballing off its own momentum. If this mass is not reached early in the novel's initial publication run, then the novel just sort of sputters out unless there's some sort of cult following that grows and demands more prints. As you can guess, this is kind of rare.\n\nGranted this scenario applies mainly to fledgling novels from authors who have not had NYT Best sellers, pirating a NYT Best seller really won't have much impact aside from a few less dollars in an author's bank account.\n\nIf you're ok with denying an author money for their efforts and labor, I don't really think I can convince you otherwise. Piracy is a pretty hard-to-argue concept because of the whole \"if I didn't pirate, I wouldn't read it anyway\" argument.\n\nStill, I think any decent person who reads a book and enjoys it should kick some money towards the author for their efforts.",

The same argument can be made for caffeine in energy shots, which in many cases are restricted (though I don't know of anything federally). \n\nSo, e-cigs need to be restricted due to their potential for concentrated doses, while sodas and typical caffeinated beverages (coffee/tea NOT energy drinks) do not carry the same risks.\n\n*Edit: phone spelling errors",
    "rejected": "An addiction to caffeine is easily manageable, while an addiction to nicotine is much less so.  Furthermore, a prevalence and common usage of e-cigs for minors allows for easier addiction/translation to normal cigarettes, which are far more harmful than caffeinated beverages.  If minors are smoking e-cigs habitually, it can act as a gateway to forming a real smoking habit.  \n\nYour complaint against high fructose syrup is completely tangential.  Many people drink coffee, often black, and many soda drinkers stick with diet sodas.  This is an issue in and of itself, and not related to caffeine.  More importantly, the addictiveness of soda you attribute to caffeine is most likely due to the sweet taste of soda, not the caffeine.  How many young kids who drink soda on a daily basis do you know who are also addicted to black coffee?  If caffeine were the issue with soda, kids would be drinking coffee (which contains far more caffeine) rather than soda, or simply popping caffeine pills (which are considerably higher in caffeine content and far cheaper).  Kids drink soda for the same reason they eat candy bars: a sweet tooth.  I think your beef should be with high fructose corn syrup, not caffeine.\n\nAdditionally, caffeine's benefits are multitudinous.  Caffeine has been shown to increase athletic performance, improve mental aptitude, prevent Alzheimer's and various heart diseases, and acts as an antioxidant.  \n\nE-cigs, on the other hand, have no proven benefit to individuals.  If anything, the ingredients in e-cigs are harmful (though this has not been proven either, only suggested).  \n\nSome sources on caffeine:\nhttp://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20110506/new-clues-on-caffeines-health-benefits\nwww.caffeineinformer.com/top-10-caffeine-health-benefits\nhttp://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/health-benefits-caffeine"

    "prompt": "I think a woman touching a guy's butt/chest is as inappropriate as it'd be vice versa. CMV.",
    "chosen": "I mean, it's changing considerably but I know what you mean, or at least how your perceiving it. This is why I think it occurs:\n\n1. Men's chests aren't deemed to be sexual areas, that's why you guys can walk around with your tops off everywhere and it not be 'obscene' or 'public nudity' whereas women walking around with no clothes on top would be. You make the point below that it's your choice where your want to be touched, yes - but society has deemed things that are ok, are sometimes ok and are not ok in public/without consent. So I can tap your shoulder from behind to get your attention, I can probably touch your elbow while flirting, I can't really grab your junk without enthusiastic consent. If your lines are different from society's that's something you have to deal with, not society. The west has deemed men's chests as relatively non-sexual, so you can't expect people to act like your chest is different. \n\n2. The situation. Obviously there will be exceptions to this - but in general women tend to touch men when they are flirting, whereas there's a pretty strong trend for men to just grab at women. There has not been a single club night in which me and my friends have not been grabbed, and often we can't even work out who did it. Ditto with whenever I've been/known a waitress. Whereas whenever I've seen women grab guys asses it tends to be after at least a little flirting, which would not necessarily make it entirely ok, but more a misunderstanding of how far the flirtation has gone rather than just a random, no warning, grabbing. I also haven't had male friends get randomly grabbed, only ever during flirtation.\n\n3. perception of power. There is no denying that average guy is stronger than average girl and that throughout history the power has been on the mans side and that even today men are considered the aggressors. This perhaps shouldn't be the case, and i think we are reaching a place where we realise everyone can be sexually harassed, everyone can be the aggressors. But in the past this hasn't been the case and we always take a while to shake off these double standards. So currently a girl grabbing a guy is seen as fun and flirty, and when he doesn't want it 'oops hahahah' whereas when guys grab a girl when she doesn't want there's an inherent perception of danger (if he's willing to do that when I didn't want it what else is he willing to do?) and in a world of averages the girl is in a situation where the guy fully has the ability to attack her/rape her with her having very little means to defend herself. Whereas (again, world of averages) the guy can usually pretty easily push a girl away if and when she goes too far. But, like I said, I think this is changing.\n\n4. as for the guys then calling each other pussies, this is the double standard of genders and sex. In general women are considered sluts if they sleep around a lot, so will aim to look like they're not sluts, possibly by 'overreacting' to being touched by a guy when they didn't want to be (although some reaction is warranted of course) whereas men are all supposed to be super macho masculine guys and getting all the girls, so seeming to turn one down looks unmasculine. Obviously this double standard hurts both parties in terms of sexual harassment and grabbing, guys are told they should love it when it happens and do it to be a man, girls then get subjected to it. \n\n5. I'm not sure you can show that people don't take it seriously. I think men are less likely to report it as it's seen to be weak, but I think once reported it would be treated the same, although I don't have any stats, do you? ",
    "rejected": "I'm going to start with the following disclosure: all people deserve to have their desire for personal space respected. All unwanted touches are inappropriate.\n\n/u/Nietzsches-Mustache has done a great job of explaining the psychological aspect of a man touching a woman, but let's talk a little bit about the social aspects of the male and female body.\n\nMan chest vs. Female Chest -- Generally speaking people in Western countries are taught that female breasts are \"private areas\" part of the sexual organs that shouldn't be displayed or touched in a public setting. That status elevates them to \"no touchy\" under most circumstances. Men however can walk topless without fear of being told they are being \"brazen\" or...oh fuck...what's the word...idk...exhibitionist isn't right but it gives the idea. Inappropriate, whatever. So man breast isn't a taboo area of conversation, people wouldn't be like to perceive it as a sexually aggressive move for a woman to touch a man's chest/man boob.\n\nWoman Ass vs Man Ass -- this one's a little harder to break down, however, I think most of the issue with this comes from the social perception of who is normally the sexual aggressor, i.e. the one who initiates flirting and/or sex. Men do. Therefore the action of a man touching a woman's ass is \"typical man behavior\" society has strict rules about this, and it is therefore accepted. A woman touching a man's ass is...rarer and because of the typical perspective that men are the sexually aggressive gender any overt action by women is probably expected to be well received or at least tolerated.\n\nI think this speaks to the reason why lawsuits are easier to win from the female perspective."

Situations where a human's rights would be violated similarly violate an animal's.\n   3. It is morally right to use violence in defense of individual rights.\n\nThe first seems like a category error. So far as we know, animals do not have language, so the notion that they have a right to free speech is difficult. This shows the contradiction in the reasoning. Perhaps animals should have _some of the same rights_, but they don't appear to need _exactly the same rights._\n\nThe second assumes that our empathy for animals is an accurate interpretation of their experience,  rather than anthropomorphism. However, anyone that's owned a dog can see this isn't really true. Dogs happily accept the collar and leash, but it would be a truly exceptional person that was willing to be led around in public that way. You would feel imprisoned by a cage, while a domesticated bird experiences it as a kind of security against predation.\n\nThe third assumes there is no better way. Nearly every society eschews violence against people and their property whenever possible. Since you live in a Republic where it is possible to use advocacy to change the law, you are morally obligated to do so.

After all, those people depend on those farms for income.  \nAnd even if the act of forcefully destroying their source of life-sustaining income (from their point of view) doesn't lead to a clash, the farm workers would be out of a job, and if that was carried on a large scale the economy is likely to suffer, and press further on the world's supplies of vegan alternatives.  \nThat and you have a bunch of grudge-holding unemployed people, which isn't too good.\n\nAnd though I agree with you that factory farms are horrible, I also think that farmers try to minimise unnecessary pain to the animal slaughtered.\n\nOn a side note, may I ask why did you chose to be a vegan and not a vegetarian?

Netflix ran into this problem with Verizon recently, where Verizon's internal network was fast, but they refused to add additional links to the connection between Verizon and Netflix (despite all the demand from Verizon customers for such a connection).  As a result, a bottleneck was created.\n\nBut, finally, recognize that there is a chicken-and-egg problem here: If, say 25 Mbps service is impossible to get at a decent price, then there will not be anybody offering up internet content that makes use of that service.  After all, why spend a bunch of money putting something on the internet that nobody has the technical ability to receive?   \n\nWhat would those services look like?  High-quality 1080p video, for example, can chew up 10Mbs.  And, what if you want video the other way-- say you have security cameras in your house and want them monitored (and recorded) remotely?

    "chosen": "Your perspective is pretty common, which is to see welfare as solely benefiting the people who are receiving it. From this angle, what you're saying makes sense: taking money from people who have worked hard to earn it and giving it to people who aren't working seems wrong. What I'd ask you to do is to consider a different perspective, which is that the purpose of welfare is not to benefit just the recipients, but to benefit society.\n\nPoverty isn't just bad for the people in poverty; it's bad for the society as a whole. More poverty results in more crime, which hurts even people who are not in poverty. It results in more economic stagnation. It results in decreased property values, in rising insurance rates, in the spread of disease and drugs and other social ills. Even if you're well-off, it is in your interest to reduce or at least stabilize poverty in your society, because having it spread will make life worse for you and everyone else. Everyone benefits from both reducing poverty and preventing people from falling into it.\n\nSo. Welfare. In the best case scenarios, welfare can help people rise out of poverty and into higher classes like your mother. This is great! But even in the case where it doesn't, where someone takes welfare and stays on it, the welfare is keeping them from sinking lower into poverty. Someone who gets a welfare check every month, spends it, and doesn't get a job isn't great for society, but if you take that person's welfare check and they turn to mugging people or starving in the street, that's much worse. More importantly, with someone who gets welfare and stays unemployed but has kids, the welfare may make the difference between their kids being able to rise out of the cycle of poverty a generation later vs being trapped in it. It's an investment.\n\nThe benefit of a strong social safety net isn't just for the people falling into it. It's for everyone, even those well above.",

All I really noticed was your example of the \"Reason Rally\". The link you gave didn't give much immediate information on their purpose in Washington so [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_Rally#Purpose) is the Wikipedia link.  \nI'm going to touch on their three points for a second and why I don't think they are dogmatic.\n\nThese points seem to deal more with problems in our society surrounding the prevalence of religion and alleviating those problems rather than some sort of \"religious anti-religion\" agenda. Also, I don't think it's a coincidence that this \"New Atheism\" exists predominantly in the USA.  \n\n * Their first goal is to encourage skeptics/agnostics/atheists to be more open about their (lack of) beliefs and to not be afraid of sharing it if it comes up in conversation for example. AFAIK, this isn't really an issue in Europe, and it probably doesn't matter a lot even in urban America. But in many  parts of America, especially the South, it can be very difficult for someone that isn't comfortable with their family/friends/community's religious lifestyle to speak up. It's not a matter of helping people be open about their atheist identity, it's about helping to be open about religion *not* being a part of their identity.  \n\n * Many people don't understand what an atheist really is. I've spent some time in the South and when I see people interact with atheists it's shocking the number of people who ask questions like \"So do you worship the devil?\" or \"Do you hate religion?\" or \"How do you know what's right and wrong?\" I'm not saying this is a majority or even *that* many people. I'm just saying it exists, and this is something the Reason Rally folks want to stop.  \n\n * The past few years there has been a clear anti-science attitude in much of Washington. With many major debates in legislation (global warming, homosexuality, abortion), the opposing views stem from religion. The people of the Reason Rally want to encourage logical thinking without the bias of religious, not necessarily to get rid of religion altogether.\n\nI really don't think this is a very good example of the \"dogmatism\" that you describe.

If you lived in a place where 90 procent of the people are Muslim then it would be way more normal for you to attend events for non-Muslims. In places like the Netherlands it would be very weird to do an atheist convention, but in countries where Atheists are a small minority that might be different. \n\nAnd especially because religion has a large impact on your life it is not that weird to get angry with it. Maybe your parent's forced you to follow a religion, maybe you were bullied because you didn't follow a religion. Then it might be beneficial to go to a group of people that think the same as you do, or have experienced the same things.\n\nThis is more about the fact that there are legitimate reasons to go to atheist conventions though.\n\n(I disagree with your definition of religion/religious, but I understand what you mean, some groups can certainly feel dogmatic and have their beliefs formed on faith.)\n"

    "chosen": "OP, I might argue your points about it being harder to come out due to social repercussions based on a few points.  Let me tackle this by 1) showing what the misconceptions of being gay are, 2) talking about the gender difference in social outlook (there *is* one), and 3) finally, discussing why I think you might feel the way you do about some of your points.  \n\nTo tackle misconceptions about gays and potentially how it's **just** as bad to come out as gay (if not worse);\n\n- Gays are still viewed as disgustingly promiscuous. \n- If you're gay (especially a male), expect to have all your ignorant peers of the same gender assume that you're immediately sexually attracted to them.\n- People still think it's perfectly socially acceptable to use gay as a negative (i.e. OP is a faggot).  How many people say \"OP is a bisexual\"?\n- There still exists a large population of people who think homosexuality is simply a choice or mental defect.\n- (Males predominantly), PDA is extremely frowned upon.\n\nGender difference and social acceptance;\n\n- Let's face it, in America (I'm assuming you're from the US, OP?), females are more likely to be dismissed as \"experimenting\" than anything else.  Males tend to receive a harsher social judgement.  I'm paraphrasing Dan Savage here, but he said something along the lines of \"A girl can kiss 100 other girls and still be curious.  However, if you took the biggest, toughest, baddest dude you know, and he sucks *one* dick...he's labeled as gay forever.\"  Given, Savage said it much better/funnier than me, but there's some truth to it.\n- Bisexual girls tend to be more socially accepted than their male counterparts.  This, in part, is due to the douchey nature of straight men.  I realize there's a whole lot more to it than this, but douchey \"bros\" certainly don't make it better.\n\nLastly, why you might feel the way you do about some of your points;\n\n- I think maybe it's perceived that Bisexuals are more likely to cheat is because of the false notion that having twice the dating pool automatically means you'll take those opportunities.  Honestly, I don't see how this makes it any *harder* to come out as Bi than gay...this point might make it *equally* hard to come out, but certainly not harder.\n- The notion that you can't really be bisexual &amp; that bi women only do it to turn guys on.  To be honest here, this one is a little muddy.  Why?  Because it's certainly the case that, somewhere in the 90s, it somehow became socially \"cool\" or \"edgy\" for a girl to say she's Bi.  Now I'm not saying that you fall into this category, what I'm saying is that **the fakes have spoiled things for the genuine**.  In my *personal* experience (I used to go out to the bars in my younger days), I met a good portion of girls who would go out and say they're bi and drink and make out/fondle other girls all the while having men take phone pics and cheer them on.  None of these girls would ever date another girl, or get intimate with another girl.  They would just say it's alcohol induced girlish fun, and the guys like it (yes, I've been told that before).  It's a sad state that \"Bi\" has become the party girl code for \"I like to get drunk and skank out to be an exhibitionist\", but it's true.  That's not the fault of the genuinely bisexual community.  Again, I don't see how this makes it inherently *harder* for you to come out as bisexual.  I see how it could make it harder for you to be taken seriously, but not harder on you socially. \n\nIn the end, I'm neither gay nor bi (I'm a heterosexual black male), and I say this so that you know something about the stranger on the internet who's dolling out CMV advice.  I don't personally know the plights of the LGBT community, because I've never had to live them.  The above that I offer is from my personal observation, experience, and education.  ",
    "rejected": "It's not harder to come out. It's just harder to *stay* out.\n\nMy bi friends who end up in long-term opposite-sex relationships get assumed by their families to have \"settled down\" and be \"straight now\" and so everything worked out alright. Their same-sex exes are also more likely to whine that those relationships were just experiments and they were taken advantage of, but those exes would've been whining about something anyway.\n\nFrankly, most of the reason that gay people have issues with bi people comes down to *jealousy*. A gay person can never, ever be with the one they love without it being obvious that they're gay. A bi person can, since they can fall in love with someone of the opposite sex. They can get married and have kids the natural way. Their dating pool is also nearly 11x as big. A gay person's dating pool is about a 10th of the sex they like, so about 5% of the population. A bi person's dating pool is the 47ish% of the opposite sex that's straight or bi, plus that gay or bi 5% of their own sex.\n\nSo yeah, you're going to have slightly more issues with other gay people than a kinsey 6 would. And that's pointless and stupid and sucks. But on the other hand, you still have the entire world of heterosexuals to choose from. There are gay women out there who won't date bi women, but there's not nearly as many of them as there are straight/bi men who will. I'd consider that more than a fair trade. (Plus those particular close-minded gay women tend to have other issues. I wouldn't date one, and I'm not bi.)\n\nBeing bi also makes being poly a heck of a lot more convenient, if you later decide that's your thing. I'm starting to feel downright *selfish* as being one of the few people at one end or the other of the kinsey scale in my group of friends.

Theoretically I'm in favor of competence-voting. Only being allowed to vote when you have either spent some time researching parties, have a basic level of intelligence or some other threshold.\n\nThe problem with all possible requirements one can come up with is that we have no way of objectively testing them. As far as intelligence goes we have IQ-tests. These are known to be inaccurate. Now for your own suggestion: \n&gt; \"Name 5 points of agenda from the party you are voting for\".\n\nThe problem with this is twofold. Firstly I think it's reasonable to vote for a certain party for less than 5 reasons, or because you agree with their ideology. For example: I might want to vote for the green party because I think the environment is an important issue. I wouldn't then be able to name five of their agenda points, but it would still be a reasonable vote.\n\nSecondly, the test will never be objective. Someone will litterally have to check whether the answers given are correct, and they might be extremely biased. For example: you would (much like me) probably very rarely allow a vote for the populistic party go through.",
    "rejected": "Well, first of it sounds like this would be very, very inpractical. - how many people vote in the Netherlands? I found a source that says it's over 9 million people.\n\nOk, so you want to test them all. - at the voting booth just before they can vote, too. There are three ways to do that:\n\n*a) oral test: fair in some ways, because some people have the right knowledge of what they think their party stands for, but problems with the buzz words. They can explain it to another person, taking all the time they need.  - drawbacks:   1. you need people, volunteers or paid, just to listen in. If you want to get voting done soon and not over, say, at least a week, you need lots of those people. 2. Said people need to be knowledgeable on various parties, so experts. 3. They need to be unbiased. In many ways! They need to accept a person's view they find bad, if it aligns with the party the person wants to vote for. They need to not let friends/family /people they like get through easy. Etc.\n\n*b) written text: can be done in a booth with the voting and later on worked through by experts to decide if vote is accepted. Get's voters out of booth fastest. - drawbacks: 1. Some people who know what they want to say suck at writing it down. Other people just are not good with tests. Others again have atrocious handwriting. 2. You still need experts going through that. The tine it costs till voting a are counted, the man power needed ( and probably wages paid) etc. just shifts from \"before voting\" to \"after voting\". 3. To make this faster people might look for \"buzzwords\" given out by the parties. In which case they could overlook voters points, which are right, but differently worded ( it has happened in test markings, at school, now imagine it at bigger scale) 4. A person who votes will never know if there vote was accepted, thus maybe making voters less likely to vote as they worry that they are not in control anyway. - sending out letters with information of \"vote accepted/not accepted\" might cost more time, manpower and money.\n\n*c) multi choice tests: every party supplies a certain amount of questions. Everybody expects that a voter knows, say, 80% of the answers. A voter is asked to  \" fill out those items which fit your party\" ( or similar, better wording). Those might be fed through a computer, which knows if Peter voted for party x, questions 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 19, 20... Should have been filled in, too. Less man power and time is needed than in the other possibilities. - drawbacks: 1. The pencil did not leave a dark enough mark. Peter filled in question 8, but then erased it. The computer can not read this... At my university there is always a certain percentage of multi choice tests that need human working in the end. I expect the same with voting. So you still need people who go through everything. Less people, but still more ( and more time) than counting votes needs right now. 2. The wording of some questions is confusing or two different parties have the same agenda in One point, but word it differently. Peter clicks the wording of part y instead of party x. This can be avoided by so embody young through the questions the parties sent in and merging similar answers, which then are accepted for both parties. Some extra work on part of government, but not too much. 3. Being aware what the party stands for, but not the words they use. In free writing or talking you might get that point across, in multi choice questions you might be lost. 4. Parties trying to avoid point three and sending in incredibly simple questions. Every voter gets them right, but they show no deeper understanding. This would defeat the purpose of the test. 5. Sone parties doing number three, some number four. This now means a disproportional amount of voters get accepted for being voters for party y over voters for party x. - some people WILL spin this as \"party x voters are uneducated snd don't even know what their party stands for\" .\n\nSimply put, I think administering your test would be a nightmare in impracticality. - and this does not even catch any possible moral problems it might have ( as I am sure others will do that) ."

Now, whether those deaths are due to the fact that a gun was left unlocked versus the person who committed suicide had access regardless of the lock is a question to think about. \nAlthough the relative statement of \"Too often\" is definitely appropriate. \n\n&gt;To give people an incentive to lock up there guns and keep them away from others\n\nHere, I think, is the main issue. For starters, a lot of gun owners have guns for home defense. Locking a gun up for home defense is like putting a safety on the brake pedal (a I'm bad at analogies right now but it still works). I can't ask the home invader(s) to wait while I go to the gun safe, unlock it, unlock the gun itself, load it, etc. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother is how would the whole stolen versus not actually stolen thing work? Since when is the person with access to a firearm going to give it to someone to commit a crime or commit suicide? Never. So if the person trying to commit the crime/suicide doesn't already have access to a firearm (they have the key and lock) they are going to steal it. Most gun locks can be fixed with a pair of bolt cutters anyway. \n\nSo we have determined that most people who have guns have them for the purposes of home defense, and thus, would have to keep the guns unlocked/easy to access. And that nobody (as in legal gun owners) are going to purposefully give someone access to their firearm so that crimes and be committed. So the gun will be stolen.\n\nThere is an inherent risk and responsibility that goes with owning a gun. You seem to understand that. I think you might want to look at your definition of \"others\". You seem to assume that everyone besides the gun owner wants to access the gun for malicious purposes. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the charges of reckless endangerment and criminal negligence. Both I think are proper charges to consider when someone is actually negligent with a gun. But to hold them accountable for everything that happens with it like you suggest is a bit much and ineffective incentive. \n\nAnother analogy that comes to mind is parents letting their kids use their cars. Should the parents be held accountable for the actions of their child just because it is their car? Sure there is some accountability with teaching your kids properly, but that doesn't hold up in court. ",

More skills can be learned after that (pointers, recursion, etc.), but if you don't know the basic five you're soon going to find yourself in a job market where you might as well be illiterate. You can flip burgers, but you can't even make it to manager anymore.\n\nRight now there are a huge number of small businesses that must wait until somebody else writes a program for them to do something as trivially simple as take seat reservations from a new gadget, or payment from Bitcoin/Whatevercoin, or even just update their mobile web site whenever their restaurant has a table free.\n\nThings like the above aren't hard. If you think it was trivial to write the 6 formatted and properly spaced, properly spelled and punctuated paragraphs in your OP, then understand that a few high-school courses in computer programming would get you to view the construction of a basic Javascript program the same way.",
    "rejected": "Teaching programming at an early age is a very good way to introduce children to logic. When you learn to code in even a basic fashion you learn how each section is logically connected to another. When I was younger logic was largely introduced to me in my geometry class through proofs. I personally found these very confusing and learned very little. Coding, I actually could wrap myself around because I could actually see how and WHY \"X\" led to \"Y\". \n\nI think learning helped me with computers overall in general. I understand how they work better and I can fix problems with my laptop that I previously wouldn't have because I at least *understand* what is roughly attempting to do. I'm not in an IT field but the one semester I spent learning how to code was well worth it. \n\n&gt; I'm not huge on Tumblr or any blog stuff where knowing code could be cool/useful. Maybe I will one day but it's mostly user friendly to begin with and you don't need to know code.\n\nMy question is if you could code, would you find yourself utilizing many of the features you now think are irrelevant?\n\n I play the game ARMA and for most people you don't need to learn how to code at all to enjoy it. The mission editor is simple enough that even the most basic person can set up a mission by themselves and have fun. What I found was that my little experience in coding allowed me to take advantage of the editor more. Yes, I didn't need to but I really found myself getting more out the game thanks to my ability to understand some coding. \n\nIf you asked me day 1 if I would ever find a use for coding I almost certainly would have told you no. In my experience though, I just keep finding little areas where that knowledge did make a huge difference and was certainly worth the effort. \n\n"

    "prompt": "Bar / Nightclub culture would be more fun / safer for women if there were more gay men harassing straight men.",
    "chosen": "Before I state my view on this I would like to say that it is apparent (whether true or not I just mean visible) that women are more aggressively propositioned than men are. That being said I have been propositioned by both men and women. I can only think of one occasion where a man has propositioned me and he was definitely persistent; though that may have been because I was not clear enough or he was too drunk to realize.\n\nThe problem isn't a matter of empathy, but a matter of communication and entitlement. A pleasant conversation between two people at a club can be interpreted as friendly or flirting. Alcohol sure as hell doesn't help make intentions clearer. I believe that drunk people are like children. They feel everything to excess. Anger, happiness, sadness, arousal, and really any other emotion seems to be amplified. This is why people do stupid things when they are hammered. Alcohol does also impair decision making, so the rational thought \"Hey I probably should leave this girl alone.\" does not occur.\n\nI don't think harassing men would do very much to help the situation. This is because the people who make the bar/club unsafe for women are not the people who would see the error of their ways. Rape is an act of power and therefore placing a person willing to rape in a situation in which they would feel helpless could actually do the opposite of the desired effect. \n\n\nI would also like to state that most guys do not ignore that type of shit. If you see that shit happen at a club/bar try telling a random group of guys what is happening. Regardless if you know them or what is happening they will come to help you and the victim. \n\nI understand what you mean though, most people don't notice it or are willfully ignorant. Putting someone in the situation where they are forced to witness what is happening will force them to act. Especially if they are in greater number. Nobody wants to act alone, but everyone wants to be apart of the crowd doing the right thing.\n\nTo sum it up: Placing gay propositioners will do nothing (in my opinion) to make bars/clubs safer. Showing bar/club goers that that sort of behavior will. So we should ban all alcohol. Just kidding alcohol fucking rules.\n\n\n",
    "rejected": "I don't see what's to be gained here, unless you had those gay guys specifically target the men who were doing this.\n\nIf you had them just going around indiscriminately doing the same thing to guys that you see being done to women, then what have you really accomplished except to make the evening suck for everyone instead of just the women?  \n\nAlso, this logic just isn't sound.  Being a victim yourself doesn't necessarily reduce the likelihood that you'll be a perpetrator.\n\nLook how many child abusers were themselves abused as children.  Or how many perpetrators of domestic violence have, themselves, been victims.  The empathy might work for a handful of people, but for the drunk people that are harassing women, being harassed themselves isn't going to suddenly open their eyes about how it makes other people feel.  \n\nThey're drunk.  If they were thinking logically they wouldn't probably be in that position to begin with."

Almost all of Europe was fairly united in their opposition to Napoleon and you cannot wage war against an entire continent, no matter how good of a general you are. Add the fact that many of the reasons that were behind Napoleon's earlier successes were no longer present - the allies had reformed their armies, were coordinating their operations better, and learned from their previous mistakes. France, on the other hand, was drained of its manpower and was economically exhausted. In short, Napoleon's chances of rebuilding his empire were very slim. At best, he would be embroiled in continuous game of wack-a-mole where one part or another rebelled. It would be an unending war with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of casualties. \n\nThat aside, the article is extremely generous to Napoleon, more than he deserves. Napoleon crowned himself Emperor - hardly a republican thing to do. He invaded countries or threatened them  with invasion to make them comply with his demands. He installed his family members and close associates as kings and dukes of conquered territories. He forced conquered peoples to pay him taxes to fund his next campaigns and enforced the continental blockade against their will. \n\nYou can't really frame the Napoleonic wars as ones of republicanism  vs monarchism. Britain was a constitutional monarchy and was staunchly against Napoleon. In Spain, Napoleon faced a national uprising against his rule (or rather Napoleon's brother whom he tried to install as king).  \n\nSaying that Napoleon wanted peace in 1805 or 1809 is a bit disingenuous. Saddam Hussein also wanted peace after conquering Kuwait. Does that make the United States and the UN forced that launched Operation Desert Storm in 1991 the aggressors? Hitler didn't want war with Great Britain and France after he invaded Poland in 1939. They declared war on Germany - are they the aggressors? Why should we take 1805 or 1809 as the baseline?

The modern face of men's rights is one that attempts to break down societal gender constructs, i.e. masculinty = man, femininity = woman, while empowering both women and men to rise above them.\nI am a woman but I've been an ardent men's rights activist for my entire life, and it pains me to see ridiculous and often ill-informed opinions on one of society's most prevalent issues.

Any legitimate, academic discussion of feminism acknowledges that gender constructs affect men to a great degree, and I've yet to meet a single educated feminist who would disagree. I understand that there are radicalists in every movement out there, but fringe opinions do not affect my beliefs.\n\nYou can write it off as a fringe minority, but there **is** a major trend in modern feminism (obviously more on reddit/tumblr than among educated feminists) that is retalitory, that is attempting to acheive \"equality\" by removing men's rights rather than advancing women's. There have been countless examples of automatic blind allegience to the woman in legal cases, be it allimony, child custody, or rape claims. These have the potential to destroy a completely innocent man, with nothing he says beleived, and that is terrifying. I checked out MRA because to me, feminism seemed more \"anti-man\" than \"pro-women\", and it was those attacks on men that neccesitated the MRA.\n\nFeminism uses \"rape-culture\" to villainize men. Rapists are villains, I 100% agree. But not all rapists are men and not all men are rapists. I REALLY don't like being associated with rapists just because someone of my gender did something terrible to a woman. I've been told many time that I don't get an opinion because I am a man, even by the same people who criticized me for not being involved. \n\nIt seems like feminism likes to have a \"all men are this way\" sort of attitude, and it that kind of sexist global lumping, especially the \"you don't get an opinion because of your gender\", really don't seem like things a feminist who was concerned with any true equality would ever support.\n\nI realize these are straw man arguments and anecdotal, but it was what made me turn away. I want true equality, and while I understand that that is also the goal of (educated) feminism, the movement as a whole is too hate-filled for me to willingly associate myself with.\n\nAnd then of course there are tons of asshole MRAs who are misogynists, and trying to devalue legitimate feminist concerns, which pissed me off and is why I don't identify as that. \n\nI guess there are assholes in every group. \n\n**TLDR: I was a feminist, but it got a little anti-men.

I've personally bent a mac even before their thickness was sub-1-inch.\n\n&gt;In the same way that most business programs are made for windows (that can be run through bootcamp), most art and music programs are made for mac (which cannot be run with a windows computer at all).\n\nThis was true in the 90s.

Stereotypically, women are expected to be kind and nurturing, communal, and modest, while they are not expected to display anger. Expressing an emotion that doesn’t line up with people’s beliefs about gender-appropriate behavior could lead to being given a lower status at work, and consequently, a lower wage.[4]\n\nA 2008 study found that men who expressed anger in the workplace were given a higher status, while women who expressed anger in the workplace were given a lower status, regardless of their actual position in the company. A trainee and a CEO who were female were both given a low status when displaying anger. Additionally, women who displayed anger in the workplace were assumed to have something internal influencing their anger, as opposed to having an external reason to be angry. Men more often had their anger attributed to an external cause.[4]\"\n\nThere have been many studies showing that women earn lower pay, not in general, but for *the same job* as a male counterpart. I can look for those if asked, but they are pretty easy to find.

Well it should, according to the [SUNY](https://www.suny.edu/smarttrack/tuition-and-fees/) website it'll cost about $22k/yr for college.

The US doesn't regulate either of these like Sweden apparently does.  That means these are things you'll have to negotiate up front with your employer.  Some companies treat any day you're not at work as a day off and you have one pool of days you can be away from work.  Some companies have two pools, one for sick time and one for vacation time.  Sick time applies to family members for most companies so it's very unlikely there'd be a 3rd pool for when family members are sick and there's little chance you wouldn't collect a full days pay when you used sick time for either yourself or family.

Here's the thing, we have 322m people spread out over almost 10m sq km.  So we have over 30x the people Sweden does and 20x the land mass so when the media leads you to believe that all these things are happening right next to each other, they're painting a bad picture.  The bigger thing for you will more likely be the small things.  From my understanding Swedes don't talk to strangers almost under any circumstance where in the US a good number of people will think it rude not to say hi as you pass someone in a hallway or sidewalk etc.  (This doesn't apply to busy crowded hallways and sidewalks and isn't very strict by any means)  \n\nReally, this probably all comes down to whether you and your family *want* to live in the US.  Life is too short to come to the US because you make extra money and can get more stuff.  Why not visit one of the cities that has a company that wants to hire you.  Maybe you can get them to pay your airfare and hotel while you're here even.  See if you like it and then decide but don't decide for or against until you visit.",
    "rejected": "You make a lot of good points, but I'm not at all convinced by this:\n\n&gt; The Swedish society seems \"calmer\" that what i believe happens in the US. There are of course cases of racism and public disobedience, but not to the extend of Fergusson or some other similar events.\n\nAccording to a quick Google search: The population of the US is 318.9 million. The population of Sweden is 9.593 million. Doing the math: The US has over 33 times more people than Sweden.\n\nEven if the two places were identical in all other respects, you can expect 33 times more of *everything,* including the really bad stuff. And the news prioritizes the really bad stuff.\n\nThe US is also really, really big. Again, going from lazy Google searches: Sweden is some 173,000 square miles, or about 450,000 square kilometers. The US is some 3.8 *million* square miles, or 9.8 *million* square kilometers. It's also mostly empty -- our population is massively concentrated on the coasts.\n\nIf you're in IT, the obvious likely place you'd end up is Silicon Valley, which is about a two *thousand* mile drive from Ferguson. That's a longer drive than it is from Stockholm (Sweden) to Madrid (Spain). You're considerably closer to Kiev (Ukrane), which literally *is* a war zone.\n\nWhether you actually want to be in the Bay Area is another question, but that's not the point. You can live in New York City, which, to be fair, is only some 968 miles from Ferguson. Point is, the US is big, and if you really have companies begging you to come here, you can probably afford to pick a part of it that's not at all like Ferguson.\n\nA quick run-down of your other points:\n\n&gt; Salaries seem much better in the US (both on paper and assuming that taxation is higher in Sweden). However, some huge differences seem to exist between different areas in the US...\n\nYep, largely because cost of living can be vastly different. I mentioned the Bay Area -- look at the rent here, and compare it to the rent in, say, Iowa or Texas.\n\n&gt; Sweden has a state supported health system, which means that worst case scenario i will pay in a year approx $120 for doctor visits (medication not included). Even operations and \"longer\" treatment is covered by this amount. This is definitely not the picture i have from the US, where a sickness can destroy you financially.\n\nThis is why, in the US, people generally have health insurance. If you took a reasonably well-paid IT job, you could expect your employer to *also* pay for your health insurance, and probably that of your immediate family. This is a profoundly *weird* system, but it means that if you're well-paid, it's probably not worse for you here than it is in a country with socialized medicine.\n\nOf course, it's *much* worse if you're poor.\n\n&gt; Vacation days seem also to be quite different. In Sweden the norm seems to be 25-30 vacation days per year, while in the US is 15-21 (?). Plus, vacation and sick days are totally different pools. When you get sick you are not paid for the first day, but you receive full pay up to day 14 of sickness. Not sure how this works in the US.\n\nIt varies *massively* from company to company. If you ever decide to come here, you need to research this thoroughly. Some companies give almost no time off, Netflix gives as much as you want. Most are somewhere in between.\n\nThat said, here, two weeks is about the norm. More than that is considered generous. This is one thing that makes me envious of Europe in general."

    "prompt": "I think that \"bodily autonomy\", by itself, is a horrible reason to justify abortion. CMV.",
    "chosen": "The bodily autonomy argument is about choice.  In the violinist hypo, you don't agree to be his life-support system.  In each of your counter-examples there is a clear choice made.  You chose to hold a knife to a guy's chest, you chose to have and raise children.  This is similar to how tort liability is found in certain cases.  You have no responsibility to save a man from drowning.  However, if you start to save a man from drowning, you have a responsibility to do so non-negligently.\n\nYour point about choosing to have sex is obviously meant to solve these problems, but the fact is that not all sex is by choice and not all sex is expected to end in pregnancy.  Rape throws a monkey-wrench in your argument.  Say a woman with abundant wealth is raped and becomes pregnant.  She might have all of the resources necessary to raise a child, it would provide her little inconvenience, and the child wouldn't be a burden on society.  The three other arguments for abortion you raised would therefore not apply.  Only body autonomy properly explains the reason why this woman should be able to have an abortion.\n\nSimilar scenarios exist when women on birth-control nonetheless become pregnant, or when a man claims to be sterile, or to have had a vasectomy, but either is not or didn't.  In these cases the choice to have sex is made with a strong presumption that pregnancy will not occur, but it does anyway.",
    "rejected": "&gt;suppose you're holding a knife at an adult's chest. Would it be ethical to make your brain send a signal to your arms, telling them to expand and push the knife through the person's chest? If not, then there is no inherent right to bodily autonomy\n\nLOL, no.  It means that you've willfully or stupidly misconstrued the basic meaning of bodily autonomy.  Bodily autonomy does not mean: \"I can literally do whatever I want, and because some of these actions involve innate biological processes I should be immune from legal consequences.\"  Bodily autonomy means:  \"You cannot invade or violate my body.  I am sovereign over the organs and tissues comprising my body.\"  \n\nBy analogy, let's look at principles of national sovereignty.  National sovereignty doesn't mean: I can do whatever I want with my government and my army, including invade your country and murder you.  It means:  I can do what I want within my borders, and you should stay within your own borders and mind your own fucking business.  \n\nNow, sometimes the principle of natural sovereignty conflicts with other important principles, like human rights.  (cf Hitler obviously).  You could say the same about the principle of bodily autonomy.  For example, there are certainly situations where utilitarians and others might argue that forcible organ donation would be a good thing.  That doesn't mean that no principle of bodily autonomy, or national sovereignty, exists or ought to exist.  Almost *any* right can be cabined by the qualifier \"...until/unless you violate the rights of others.\"  \n\n&gt; Can someone claim \"bodily autonomy\" as a defense if their own offspring starve to death from neglect?\n\nYes, if the alternative would have been to allow your offspring to eat your body.  Also, parents generally have the right to divest themselves of parental obligations at any time, giving their kids up for adoption.  \n\n&gt;However, if she made the violinist sick by having sex, then she is ultimately responsible for the violinists' death, regardless of the presence or absence of parasitic life support.\n\nThis argument would be strongest if you limited it to situations where pregnancy was intentional or where the woman knew, before having sex, that there was a nontrivial chance she'd conceive.  But I've seen versions of the violinist hypo where the guy gets drunk and negligently stumbles into the hospital wing where these experiments are being conducted.  \n\n\n&gt;Of all the possible arguments for abortion, \"bodily autonomy\" is nothing more than an appeal to selfishness.\n\nActually, assuming the listener is unlikely to need an abortion, it's an appeal to empathy and ethics.  The argument for bodily autonomy is no more \"selfish\" than any other argument for privacy, freedom or basic human dignity.  Many of these arguments rest on Western concepts of individualism, which you could dismiss as selfish if you're a creepy Orwellian type, I suppose.  But I would hope that you wouldn't dismiss these arguments as selfish *only* when they are made on behalf of dirty slutty women.  "

Feeling an emotion encourages the behaviour suitable to the circumstances. Giddy, fluttery infatuation makes you enthusiastic, easygoing and indulgent, which makes you more fun to be with and therefore increases the chances of your crush sticking around. Sadness is a form of pain, you learn to avoid circumstances that lead to it in future. Anger raises heart rate, tenses muscles, increases aggression, a clear signal to whoever's causing it to back off or making you ready to fight if need be.\n\nHaving emotions programmed into our brains is a quicker and more efficient way of triggering necessary responses than requiring our brains to work them out every time.

That means a doctor who wants to change jobs can do so pretty easily.\n\nSo let's say I'm an MD and I am looking at the following job opportunities:\n\n* Job 1: 40 hrs a week, no on call duty, salary $100,000/yr\n* Job 2: 50 hrs a week, plus 20 more on call, salary $200,000/yr\n\nAnd let's say I'm pretty close to indifferent between the two.

    "chosen": "This is just a guess, but I'm thinking that the \"their stuff\" anger is just a simplification for what men who have gone through divorce are feeling.  \n\nOur society still doesn't really let men express their feelings very well, so while a woman might be able to complain about having a broken heart, I think guys sometimes feel like they would be ridiculed for saying that they were hurt emotionally.  It's more okay for them to be upset about losing stuff, though, so that's what they complain about.\n\nI don't think it's necessary to go to extremes like some of the responses here have to feel sympathy for men who have gone through a divorce.  Maybe they were very happy to marry a woman who makes less than them, or to have a spouse that quits working to look after their children.  They didn't really think about the \"stuff\" aspect of marriage when things were good.  Then, something happens, and maybe it's no-ones fault, but the marriage breaks up.  They have all the same feelings of hurt and disappointment, but don't necessarily have the language to express it.  They look at their married life and see time spent at work, and think \"I spent all that time earning money, and now I don't even have that\".  \n\nIt takes a pretty big person to look at a failed relationship and say, \"Well, we just weren't compatible\", so I can understand wanting to get sympathy and maybe bash your ex to strangers.  And if you've been raised to not be emotionally vulnerable (which I think is still how we raise boys), then I can understand moving those emotions to the \"stuff\" aspect of marriage.",
    "rejected": "There are other factors to consider, such as the cause of the divorce.  \n\nBefore we get to that though, let's talk about the setting.  The hypothetical situation I'd like to present will be a couple with two kids, with the husband earning 100% of the pay, and the wife staying home to raise the kids.  They have a nice three bedroom house that he paid for, two cars, a retirement account, etc.\n\nHowever, the situation isn't quite that simple, because the wife gets lazy, depressed, whatever so the husband has to cover more for taking care of the kids, cleaning the house, etc.  She starts drinking heavily because of her depression, and despite his attempts to get her to want to get help, she refuses and lashes out violently at him, even hitting him.  By this point, he's basically a single dad with a roommate who lives in his house for free and helps with nothing but causes a lot of trouble for him and his children.\n\nEventually, his wife decides she's bored with her life, and starts meeting men online while her husband is at work and the kids are at school.  She sleeps with them, and picks up STDs and eventually gets into drugs as result of the quality of people she associates with.  One day, she decides she's going to run off with one of those guys and abandons her children and husband.\n\nShe then files for divorce.  This is where my argument comes to play.  She has abandoned her children and she does drugs, which would make a strong argument in favor of the husband getting full custody.  This alone would mean that he should keep more of the money simply for the benefit of the children.  Additionally, she should not be able to lay claim to any of the house, since she contributed nothing to it, and it would benefit the children to not have to move to a bad neighborhood for a 50% cheaper house.  Also, should she be able to claim any of the retirement accounts or anything else that the husband paid for in good faith, considering it was her choice to leave her family in bad circumstances after living with them in bad circumstances?  In essence, she violated the contract to care for the kids, so he should not be liable for 50% of the possessions/money to go to her.\n\nAlso, on a human level, wouldn't you feel bad for this family, and maybe feel like the woman is a bit of a bad person?  Wouldn't you feel at least a little bit of sympathy for the man in this situation?"

There's not even the funding to just fix pot holes.\n\nOther countries have stricter laws, but they are able to do that because of their excellent public transit. People are able to bike everywhere, subways are everywhere, buses/trains are regular and predictable, etc. If someone doesn't have a license in these other places, it's not a big deal.\n\nThis is not true in the US.

Plus, I know quite a few people (my parents for example) that live/work far enough away from the bus lines that they'd have to take a car to get to the bus stations/stops anyways. It's simply not conducive to anybody's life that doesn't work in a major city and live nearby enough that a bus runs to and from.\n\nYou could make an argument that we should make public transportation more accessible, but until then, cars are a 100% necessity for a lot of people."

There must be some minimum number of people who *are* having biological children, otherwise we would cease to exist. Maybe you don't have a problem with that, but that is basically saying \"existing is selfish\", and by that logic, there is no non-selfish reason to continue living. If you were really interested in being selfless, you would stop consuming resources and cease to exist (obviously extreme, but you get my point).    \n  \nSecond, in relationship to how many people there are in the world, the percentage of \"extra\" kids (that really should be adopted, whether because of financial reasons, orphans, etc) isn't tremendously high, especially in 1st world countries. That doesn't mean that adopting an orphan child from a 3rd world country isn't a *good* thing to do, because it is. But we are really talking about situations at the margins here, rather than something everyone should be doing.    \n   \nThe other category of objections is more along the lines of wanting to be a good parent and have a good relationship with your child. That really is a bit of a crap-shoot, but you seem like a thoughtful person, and that goes a long way. Also, it wouldn't really change your odds (especially not for the better) if you adopted a child. That is likely to be a harder situation especially if the child was much different than you, so those objections, as points against having a *biological* child, don't really make that much sense.",

Everyone is subject to a less-than-ideal world. That doesn't stop people from having fulfilling lives.\n\n&gt;I have no way of knowing that I will be a good parent. Why make a person when there is the chance that I will fuck them up irreparably?\n\nDo you have a reason to think this would be the case? It seems you should know if you are that flawed. Now, will you make mistakes? Yes, but you know what kind of person you are. If you know you wouldn't make a good parent, that's fine, but don't say the same goes for everyone.\n\n&gt;My biological kid might not even take after me in the ways I like. Even worse, what if I hate my kid? What if my kid is an asshole who actively makes the world a worse place?\n\nHalf of this is selfish. Half of it is your responsibility to do the best you can. There are no guarantees. If you don't want to do so, fine, but I fail to see how this supports the idea that having kids is selfish.\n\n&gt;If there's no guarantee my kid will be like me anyway, why not just adopt a kid? Even if that nurturing instinct just cannot be suppressed, it seems like a horrible idea to add new people to the world unnecessarily.\n\nDo you have genetic benefits that you would like to see passed down? I do. That's not selfish, I just realize that there are traits that I have that would make the world better. \n\n&gt;It's not like the human species is on the brink of extinction. So what if it goes extinct anyway? I have no investment in future generations.\n\nThis is inherently selfish. You have no investment, so why care?\n\n&gt;I often hear childfree people called \"selfish.\" \n\nI think it's more the rationale for being childfree. It's usually, \"I have so much fun\" or  \"I have lots of money\". There certainly are non-selfish reasons to be childfree and many people should not have children. "

However, in my school law class, we discussed this issue at length and so I'll try to 'change your view' on one part regarding religion.\n\nAs other have noted, school is mandatory in the United States.  (Ever since the Supreme Court case *Society of Sisters* in 1925)  Sure, there are exemptions such as private tutoring or private school, but these are not feasible for all people.  Without any doubt, there are people who, due to circumstance, can only attend public school and are mandated to do so by Federal law. \n\nNow, courts have certainly tried to balance the liberty of the parents/student and the greater good in cases regarding education.  One Constitutional issue that gets particular scrutiny is that relating to religion in First Amendment.  First, there is the establishment clause, which basically says government cannot establish any sort of religion.  Second, there is the free exercise clause which basically says government cannot prevent persons from freely practicing their religion. \n\nNow, we look at the issue at hand.  Some religions expressly prohibit vaccination, and forcing them to get a vaccination would almost certainly been seen as a violation of the free exercise clause.  \n\nTherefore, I wish to change your view on just this point:  Medical AND Religious exemptions must be considered, or else this idea (similar to Jerry Brown's new law in California) will be struck down by courts on First Amendment grounds.

There's a problem with that too. Roughly 40% of children in the US live in single parent home, which rules out the prospect of homeschooling and eschooling becomes unviable because it's illegal to leave your kids alone at home. You also have a large percentage of the population who can't afford or don't have access to private schools. The amount of overlap here has the potential to be very high, especially in poor neighborhoods. \n\nSo, now we have a segment of the population for whom public school is the only option. What are the odds that some of these people do not want their kids vaccinated, for whatever reason (ignorance usually, but that's not the point)? Pretty high. So now the question becomes, are we willing to fine and or imprison parents because they don't want their kid to get a vaccine and therefore won't send them to school? Personally, that is not something I'm willing to do, so I'm against mandatory vaccination in order to go to school."

    "chosen": "As a one time vegetarian (even a vegan for a few years when I was younger), for me the morality or immorality of eating meat was conditional. My reasoning was basically that animals feel pain and seem to feel emotions like fear (different animals to different extents). If there is no need for me to cause pain to an animal capable of experiencing it in order for me to meet my nutritional requirements then it is immoral for me to do so. I can in fact get all the nutrition required for healthy living without consuming products that cause animals to suffer, so I feel it is most moral for me to do so.\n\nIn fact I still feel that what I wrote above holds even though I eat meat now (we're all flawed I guess). My first girlfriend was horribly allergic to soy, and lots of other things including chocolate. She would be hard pressed to get enough protein in her diet without meat due to her dietary restrictions. I never considered it immoral for her to eat meat even though I felt it was immoral for me to do so. If I were to try to enforce my beliefs about moral dieting on others (something I wouldn't do btw) it would have to be very conditional. I might say that I think it would be best and most moral if humans who live in areas where plant based nutrients can efficiently provide for sufficient nutrition for people to be healthy to avoid consuming animal products and to stop maintaining a massive factory farming system for the production of animals for slaughter. I think this would be good for the environment, good for human health and ethical with regards to how humans treat animals.\n\nThis wouldn't be practical for many regions and many cultures at the moment and so it wouldn't make sense to view them as immoral for their dietary choices and food producing practices. Even if I held to an absolute moral conviction that humans eating meat is wrong, it still wouldn't make sense to apply that to animals. The predator prey relationships that make up life for wild animals is key to the balance of lots of different biological and natural systems. Forcibly removing all predation from the wild would cause massive harm to even cute cuddly herbivores everywhere within a few animal generations, so it wouldn't necessarily be moral. Also killing all the predators would be its own moral conundrum.\n\ntl;dr summation would be that the morality of consuming meat needs to be conditional and qualified to really make any sense at all, and that being the case it just doesn't make sense to apply it to animals or even all people everywhere. Even if you assume it to be an absolute moral principle that eating meat is always and everywhere wrong, acting on that principle would be absurd and create absurd outcomes.",

Which I doubt sharks and carnivorous fish can actually survive on.\n\nFurthermore, moral rules that apply to human beings don't necessarily apply to animals. Not all of them are capable of being trained out of certain behaviours, like eating hunting. Furthermore, not all animals have other options. Human beings can live as vegetarians because we can purchase and consume supplements and substitutes for meat, the same can't be said of animals. It would be an absurd task to capture all animals, produce meat substitutes, and feed them just to prevent them from hunting - and we would need to capture them to ensure the task was followed through because you wouldn't be able to train them all not to hunt. We haven't succeeded with dogs, they'll still go off and kill squirrels from time to time, and we've had them domesticated for ages. \n\nIt would be unethical because 1) we'd be capturing them against their consent and keeping them in sub-par living conditions 2) we wouldn't be able to feed them enough to ensure they all have a good quality of life and that would lead to them leading unhappy short lives. \n\nA cat doesn't feel guilt for killing a mouse - nor should it.

    "prompt": "It is morally and practically unjustifiable to join the Stormcloaks. (Spoilers)",
    "chosen": "Alright, I'm a pretty hardcore Stormcloak guy, so let's get this going. First things first, we both recognize that the goal of both Imperial and Stormcloak is to destroy or at least heavily damage the Aldmeri Dominion to the point where they can't be aggressive, so I won't waste time establishing that. And we both consider the political and final outcome in that regard to be more important than freedom of religion in skyrim, that the rebellion should be practical rather than principled.\n\n1 The Empire has demonstrated within recent history that they are willing to cede territory to the Thalmor. Look at what happened at Hammerfell because of the White-gold Concordat. With this in mind, there's no reason to suppose that the Nords would feel safer under the rule of the empire.\n\nAnd about Hammerfell, they successfully proved that the Altmer can be bled so much during an invasion that they will give up. If Skyrim were to successfully cecede, there's little reason to think that these nations wouldn't provide aid to one another. \n\nNow, the Aldmeri Dominion may have more might than either Hammerfell or Skyrim, possibly even both, but the successes it experiences are likely to be too costly to be worth it.\n\n\nThat's the positive military argument for secession, now let's look at the negative one. The Altmer live for a very long time, and reproduce very slowly, the common thought is that the empire will end the cease-fire in another human generation or so, and destroy the weakened elven army, but this is a very narrow point of view that misses several factors in my opinion. This assumes that Thalmor propaganda fails to make the new generation peaceable. It assumes that the Khajiit, who are very allied with the Thalmor and very capable warriors, will not join the fight. And lastly, it assumes that the Thalmor are so stupid that they didn't realize this, and just chose to end the war short of annihilating the empire because they thought true peace was possible. This is ridiculous. They have a plan, and based on the obvious lack of insight that the empire has as to what this plan is and how to counteract it, continuing under their guidance is very foolish.\n\n2 Ulfric killing Torygg is definitely a bad thing, no argument here, but is it worse than what the Empire is selling? The empires very existence is a display of Might makes Right. Skyrim became a part of the empire with the beginnings of the Septim Dynasty, to follow a Dragonborn. Once Martin dies, so to do the terms of their agreement. The Empire's entire claim to Skyrim is \"We can make you.\" Skyrim went along with this because the costs of secession outweighed the benefits, when the appraisal is made that this is no longer the case, the Empire loses its legal leverage and now only has an army for its claim. Now, as for the killing itself, I find it very important to consider one aspect, which is that it was a challenge.  The in game text seems to support the idea that Torygg could have denied the challenge and lost honor, but not the throne. This idea is floated again by Proventus Avenicii (Thalmor party lover) when talking to Jarl Balgruuf. With a common enemy, I see little reason for the Jarls to engage in in-fighting after driving out the Imperials.\n\n3 Now for some original points you may not have considered. First and foremost, the PC is the goddamn Last DragonBorn. The LDB has IMMENSE power. They couldn't conquer the Summerset Isles on their own, but with an army at their back, it wouldn't even be a challenge. The Stormcloack army (with possible Redguard support) could tear the heart of the Aldmeri Dominion out very quickly if led by the LDB. The Empire is unlikely to give the kind of military support necessary though, preferring instead their own might, and likely viewing the LDB as a political threat. Don't forget that the Empire was initially formed by such a being.\n\nThis other point ties back in to the first one, but is a little out there. What is the goal of the Thalmor? The short answer, to unmake creation. Talos worship isn't about worshiping a man who became a god, it's about the mythopoeic power that this worship has, and its role in holding the stability of creation. Think about the Thalmor \"advisor\" in the College of Winterhold, he wasn't acting alone out of insanity. The Thalmor view is that creation is a mistake, and they want to go back to being Anuic souls. This ceasefire with the empire gives them enough lee-way and free passage to go around investing and destroying the towers, and that absolutely can't be allowed to continue for the decades required for the empire to build up its forces.",
    "rejected": "&gt; 1. A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.\n\nBut clearly the Empire is not united as it appeared to be.  If it were this dissent for it wouldn't have started in the first place.   There is only one party to blame when it comes to this scenario and that is leadership. \n\n&gt; This should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion, the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.\n\nBut at-least this would actually involve fighting instead of having a puppet government.  Wouldn't you rather go down fighting than submit to this?  Just try to imagine this in a real world terms imagine the government of the nation you are in is overthrown by a foreign power and has occupational forces (which you see all over Skyrim) in your lands  with your new government giving into any and all demands.  Would you really side with that?\n\n&gt; Of course, a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor; they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out (and don't forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort). But if they cannot have that, I'm sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course, for any of those who actually like the Dominion, this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks.\n\nWith the puppet government installed and under their thumb the rebellion only stands to hurt them in the end.  If they wanted to murder all humans they would have simply continued their crusade as they were clearly winning to begin with.   Instead the human races are being beaten into submission and it's sicking that other humans are taking part in it.  \n\n&gt; There is also the matter of trade and mutual benefit. Jarl Balgruuf says as much. Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south, and in exchange Cyrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel.\n\nThe average citizen in Skyrim is not very wealthy and do not have much to show for  so this only benefits those already wealthy which is a minority of the population.   Even if you were one of those wealthy people would you feel right selling out everyone's freedom to continue access to luxury goods?   \n\n&gt; Ulfric's claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to \"might begets right\". \"Well no kidding, that's how rebellions work,\" some of you might be saying. But Ulfric's point in killing the king was that leadership comes from individual martial prowess. No king who cannot beat challengers in single combat is fit to rule. Such an attitude does not belong in any civilized society, because it is hazardous to stability. What's to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesn't like Ulfric's successor?\n\nCan you give any realistic alternative Ulfric had?   Even if Ulfric had somehow peacefully managed to convince several Jarls to switch to his side without him raising a sword for his own cause this would have still lead to the same bloodshed.   Would you follow a man that isn't willing to fight for what he believes in while sending you out to do tasks? Ulfric's successor could be voted on democratically by the other Jarls which is the proper tradition.   We are also assuming that Ulfric wouldn't be willing to put that vote up after the civil war if that was asked of him obviously he would win the vote and this would only further secure his right to the claim.\n\n&gt; It would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it, and if he had agreed, then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did, I'm convinced that Ulfric's rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition: he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg.\n\nToryyg was a puppet that was pro-empire  and not even properly elected.    The Empire also lies on the account of what happened in this scenario.  They accused Ulfric of l doing a shout that literally ripped Toryyg apart.  However we know that Ulfric lacks that amount of power to do the shouts  and Ulfric himself is both honest and humble on the subject saying he did it as  a method of knocking Toryyg  down to deliver the final blow.   Since Ulfric told the truth about that account it makes much more sense that Toryyg accepted this duel.\n\nNow, I am not going to say that the Stormcloaks are perfect because they aren't  they make bad choices too and are often emotional rather than rational.  Race is a big subject in such.   But those issues can be dealt with in time where as the Empire is under a boot and doesn't have the freedom to change.  The Stormcloaks at-least have hope.\n\nLast point I will make before awaiting your response is if we are assuming the Dovahkiin is siding with the Stormcloaks  they have the most powerful being on the planet on their side.  No one living person in Tamriel and perhaps all of Nirn can honestly boast of greater exploits.   He/she has the ability to clearly influence the war not just on the battlefield itself but because they are a hero who saved the world and that is something they can get behind.    The rebellion wouldn't stop at Skyrim it would reach all over and the Empire the true Empire not the boot lickers we have now would rise like a phoenix out of the ashes.\n\nIf we were to instead view the Dovahkiin as pro-Empire the Empire has no desire for another great war and grown content in being a puppet and keeping all their pitiful titles and riches.   The  Dovahkiin  is a oppressor in this scenario.   I would also like to note where did  Titus II  flee to when Cyrodiil fell?  Skyrim,   where did he get his reinforcements that captured it back?  Skyrim.    The Aldmeri Dominion fear Skyrim, as they do Hammerfell which they failed to conquer.  Titus cowardly surrendered in a war he would have won."

You may get out a little text at this red light, read the response at the next one, but you can't really give it your full attention because you are driving, and you aren't giving driving your full attention, because you're texting. \n\nI think when we are driving, sharing the road with other people, it's important to be present and aware.

On average, men are stronger than women, so I don’t think that it’s fair to have people with different abilities to play together.\n\nIt is a known fact that men are (no not all men are better than every women) better at sports than women naturally do to stronger physiques. The main point of bringing women in to a men's is they aren't challenged in women's leagues and must compete against a higher skill level. If a women possessed the skill necessary to compete with men, this would mitigate, as you said, different abilities. \n\n&gt; Also, since this is within the context of school, it’s not like female students don’t have opportunities to join girls’ sports teams.\n\nThis may not be true in all cases. Where I go to school, we rarely have women's teams in sports such as golf, rugby and football, and we therefore have a team. And even if they did, the men's teams have better resources and coaches due to higher levels of competition. A women may chose to join the men's team to further their development in the sport.\n\n&gt; I just believe that it would help female and male students have more confidence and develop better as athletes, if they are playing with people of similar or equal ability.\n\nGoing back to the main point of my reply, this would work better as a point for my argument than yours. If a women would be more suited to play against men, they should be allowed too. I wouldn't question whether or not women are better than men in some aspects. Canada's women's national team is probably better than most men in Canada, they still play against Major Midget Teams (2nd highest rank for males ages 15-17). The most elite women can face player better suited to their skill level.\n\nOverall, I believe that if a women can compete with men, your points are not valid for saying they are not.\n\n",

If they only offer one wrestling team, then everyone has to be allowed to join it.\n\n"

Free market economics only benefits society in some very constrained circumstances where the First and Second Welfare Theorems hold and Core convergence is allowed to happen. Basically, the market needs to be 'textbook' or else it will become distorted, and those distortions will benefit someone other than the consumer. My guess is that they will benefit enormous, American-style HMOs.\n\nHere are a few reasons why the market for healthcare is not the same as a regular market, and hence why I fear the usual conclusions of economics do not apply:\n\n* It follows a principle-agent model, so I have to trust that the doctor is providing only the care I need and not the care that is most lucrative for him (considerable evidence exists to show this is a problem even in the UK, and it is as beyond doubt as a question in the social sciences can be that it happens in the US)\n\n* There is impossible asymmetry in the market; insurance providers cannot observe how healthy you are when you apply for insurance and patients are canny enough to lie if asked, so the result is that the healthy are under-insured, the ill (and elderly) are over-insured and the poor are shafted.\n\n* Demand is irregular, and I can't predict my need for healthcare in advance, meaning I can't take steps to reduce my other consumption before I consume healthcare\n\n* Production is irregular; I pay for healthcare but I want health, and I can't guarentee that my purchase of healthcare will result in health\n\n* Avoidance of using the service is impossible (or at least very unlikely), meaning I cannot purchase a substitute to healthcare\n\n* Moreover, when I use the service I am (usually) not a rational consumer - a man having a heart attack can't pick a hospital four hours away because it has better reviews on Yelp, and even if he tells paramedics he wants to go there they would be negligent if they didn't just completely ignore him.\n\n* The profession is restricted by licensing, artificially creating an - important - barrier to entry\n\n* Price competition is frowned upon - hospitals are expected to compete on quality and this is compounded by the way insurance puts a step between the purchaser and provider\n\n* Your usage of the medical system affects my future usage (immunisation is the obvious one, following the events in Wales). I have a direct interest in your being insured that goes beyond a mere preference for your not falling ill.\n\n* Finally (and unrelated to the above) the NHS is a source of considerable national pride; the recommendations of NICE influence 25% of the global pharmaceutical market, and we are world-leaders in a whole bunch of fields including paediatrics. For an island nation of 70m people, that is not bad going at all! I would be really sad to see that go up in smoke chasing the chimera of market-based efficiency gains.\n\nSource: I'm an economist for the NHS",

We need to be able to go get check ups and tests, without paying 10,000 dollars for them. Then you don't have nearly as many 50,000 triple bypass surgeries. Also, our food in the US is ruining everyone's health as well. Government subsidies have created an enormous market of cheap unhealthy food, that poor ignorant people are eating. They're the ones who can't afford to eat right, have healthcare, get jobs, etc. Basically America is set up to fuck ignorant poor people.

    "prompt": "I do not believe photography takes a lot of skill. CMV",
    "chosen": "As with many things, the skill increases on something like a logarithmic scale - it is pretty easy to get good enough to take pretty good pictures, takes a fair bit of effort to be able to regularly take really nice photos, a lot of effort to get all really nice and a few great, and a lifetime to get lots of really exceptional ones.\n\nGetting better than your friends and being able to post facebook photos which impress them and having them call you a \"great photographer\" is in that first level, but it doesn't mean that photography is \"easy\" or doesn't take skill, it just means that the first level doesn't take much work and you the bar you are comparing to is really low. There is still a whole world of really complicated stuff that is not easy at all, but critical for professional photographers.\n\nAdditionally, the idea that it comes down to \"how still you can hold a camera\" is laughable. As an example, you can get lenses for your camera that take in more light, so the shutter length is shorter so the shake from a hand held camera doesn't affect the shot. Besides, I think anything shorter than 1/80th or 1/100th of a second exposure time basically nullifies the difference between a \"super steady\" hand and someone with Parkinsons if they aren't zoomed in too much so using highly zoomed photos, bad lenses, or low light conditions are some of the sub-cases where holding the camera steady matters *at all*.\n\nInstead, I would contend that knowing *what* to shoot (and then having enough knowledge to actually get the shot) is the real key to photography which really requires a lot of experience. Additionally, the way we view things with our eyes and how they appear on film is *very* different and to really capture the \"feeling\" of what you are seeing can take a pretty deep understanding of what will come out differently and how to translate that metal image onto film using your camera's settings.\n ",
    "rejected": "Taking a photograph is quite easy.  Seeing the world and imaging what would look good does.  Think of it as similar to drawing an image in front of you.  You have a limited amount of subject matter, but what you do with it is what determines if it's just an okay photo, or an exceptional photo.\n\nAnd in regards to holding a camera still, as a photographer, I bring my tripod everywhere, and I only shoot freehand if there isn't time to set up and I need to quickly get a shot.  Otherwise, practically all of my shots are on a tripod.\n\nAnother aspect to it is the editing process.  Yes, a lot of photos are edited unnecessarily and tend to look gaudy and fake.  When I open a few photos, I'm surprised at how much a slight tweak can change the feel of the image.  Going back to the idea of drawing or painting, making the decision to use a slightly different shade or hue of one color can make a big difference in the image, and knowing what looks good and what doesn't is a part of the skill."

    "prompt": "The only musical genre that I don't like any examples of that I have heard is dubstep. CMV",
    "chosen": "Dubstep is a true minefield. Here we go. \n\nI'm going to blindly assume this is a typical 'dubstep' example you have listened to; [Dr P - Sweet Shop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZkzcm7ubQg) \n\nThis isn't the true sound. Saying 'oh dubstep is all wob wob screeeech wib wob wob wob' is so false. Let me bring some history in. I'm from the UK, and our underground music, almost wholly from London, is absolute goldmine in terms of music culture. There is a concept of the ['hardcore continuum'](http://thewire.co.uk/in-writing/essays/the-wire-300_simon-reynolds-on-the-hardcore-continuum_introduction), which essentially theorises that underground music is \"a musical tradition/subcultural tribe that’s managed to hold it together for nearly 20 years now, negotiating drastic stylistic shifts and significant changes in technology, drugs, and the social/racial composition of its own population\". \n\n\nWe start in the early 90s, with [hardcore](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQVv40_9NSo) which was rave music, which begat drum n bass, [jungle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4_rarpCqDU), garage and 2-step (amongst others). 2-step is a sub strand of garage, focusing on broken swung rhythms and got increasingly dark in tone. Exhibit A; [El-B - Buck and Bury](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZiAL0w1R5g). So we're in the early 00s, and this sound is rife across London. Imagine a big dark room with a big soundsystem, with these edgey, nervous tunes playing out to a similarly edgy nervous audience. Could you fathom the feeling? \n\nAs this sound grew, dubstep emerged. 2-Step swinging rhythms with an emphasis on half-time drums, keeping space in the track and providing the low sub bass that is the blood of underground music. This tune is the foundation, the culmination of all of these influences that have been brewing over the years and something of a realisation that 'dubstep' is it's own genre. I present; [Skream - Midnight Request Line \\(2005\\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pTSGvp7T8) and [Digital Mystikz - Antiwar Dub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pBCA9mUciU)\n\nA large part of Dubstep was Dubplate culture. An old concept that roots back to old Dub scenes in Jamaica. The DJ would have a tune cut to a dubplate, a one off vinyl record, which they would have exclusively, or a strict handful of people would have, so fans could hear tunes from specific DJs only, on the night, in the moment. A concept that the commenters on youtube about how 'flithy the drop is' is probably way too much to handle. [Loefah - Midnight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OUxAPgV_AA). One DJ has this. I've heard it out only once, on a huge soundsystem in south london, in the moment, it send chills down my spine. This tune will never be released. \n\nExamples of people destroying raves;\n\n[Youngsta at System (Badman VIP) - WATCH THIS. Look at the reception, the reaction and the flash of lighters.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcZ1ic9zOMs)\n\n[Loefah @ DMZ8 (i was there) hear the cheer at 1.13 when the sub comes in, that's the effect.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7R-eVPwA98)\n\nSo my argument is this. True dubstep, which of course begat this whole screechy sound which has bastardised the whole thing, is a part of a long strand of music from the UK underground and is a toast to years of sonic evolution as well as cultural progression. \n\nSounds all romantic doesn't it. But some of us are totally hooked. Here is a someone you may be able to resonate with, Burial. \n\n[Burial - Wounder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVvRtJNYZR8)\n\n[Burial - Untrue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmW_r3XK2HA)\n\n\nSome other examples, spanning the whole scene;\n\n[Ikonika - Please](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Lzk_tGQB9w)\n\n[Distance - V](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1spb0C2be3U)\n\n[DMZ - Ancient Memories (Skream Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFzdhVyZYww)\n\n[Kode9 - 9 Samurai](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaU-pnassYM)\n\n\nAnd to think, dubstep was really shaking in 05/06/07. there is still a strong dubstep community and record lables pushing the sound, Tempa, Deep Medi, shout out to /r/realdubstep. Focus in the UK at the moment is more 130 driven stuff like this; [Boddika - Crack (SWAMP81)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s101Dno5Grc).\n\n\nTL;DR. Dubstep is part of a lineage of music from the UK underground which encapsulates so many roots and influences to create one of the most cutting edge, dark and moody sounds in electronic music. The vibe of an actual rave is second to none. Read all it you speng.\n",

Cluekid - Sandsnake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Neu0_LJvg) - Very dark, massive, wobbly sound.\n\n[Silkie - Selva Nova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAXQ87ZfTio) - Reminiscent of Old School Jungle, only slower. \n\nNotice how each track sounds fairly unique. This is because dubstep is an incredibly versatile genre, and there's a sound out there for everyone. Please don't let the newer artists and labels with a more westernized sound turn you off, because Skrillex and Monstercat Records are so far from the true Dubstep sound that it should just be categorized as its own genre. The unofficial name is Brostep, but that's kind of a derogatory term honestly. I'd much prefer it be called Metalstep or Heavystep or something.\n\nListen with an open mind and read about the culture behind dubstep. It's very interesting."

    "chosen": "Seeing as you've framed it such that it is not about the pure practicality of the situation (which I would say has a large hand in it) I think the difference between acting to portray someone disabled as opposed to someone another race really has to do with social context. There is much of acting that is done on screen or on stage in ways that portray different peoples, because it's all about maintaining an illusion that people can suspend their disbelief for as you tell a story. Adult female actors will often stand in for young boys in stage shows, for example. Actors all the time have to assume different personalities and races and nationalities, often without push-back from society. You have American actors who play Brits and Germans, Brits who play Americans and Aussies, etc... and to that end I really think the insult has more to do with the portrayal of the character. If the actor is competent enough to really faithfully portray an actor of a different ethnicity, and the audience can suspend their disbelief there isn't usually any issue. What issues you usually have with white actors playing roles of different races is a mixture of the widespread social stigmas because of past-wrong doings, as well as the often stereotypical portrayal which could've been better done by someone who is actually of that race. \n\nI would ask, though, for you to explain better why you think that both the impracticality doesn't matter, and why you find it offensive? If an actor can bring someone disabled to life on the screen and give a really faithful and convincing performance with due respect given to the disabilities that person has, what is there to be offended by who portrays that character? If they were to make fun of that disability, perhaps I could see your argument, but otherwise I'm at a loss. That's why I find it so odd you've ruled out practicality, because that is a huge part of it. It would be very impractical for a disabled actor to play a role, whereas it really wouldn't be impractical to get someone of the correct race to play the role. ",

The most likely reason for this outcome is that the cost shock of the minimum wage is small relative to most firms' overall costs and only modest relative to the wages paid to low-wage workers. In the traditional discussion of the minimum wage, economists have focused on how these costs affect employment outcomes, but employers have many other channels of adjustment. Employers can reduce hours, non-wage benefits, or training. Employers can also shift the composition toward higher skilled workers, cut pay to more highly paid workers, take action to increase worker productivity (from reorganizing production to increasing training), increase prices to consumers, or simply accept a smaller profit margin. Workers may also respond to the higher wage by working harder on the job. But, probably the most important channel of adjustment is through reductions in labor turnover, which yield significant cost savings to employers.\"](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf)\n\nSo yeah, it doesn't cause job losses to increase the minimum wage a reasonable amount."

Some ancient folks had 2-person relationships; some didn't.\n\nWhich is to say, no, humans are not meant to be monogamous. Humans are meant to survive, period. That's it.

Which means some people will fall more on one side of a spectrum, and others will fall more on the other.\n\nAll of which is to say, the natural state of humans appears to be to have there be a tension between the desire to partner/pair up and reproduce, and the desire to still sex up people who are not your partner. Seems like a lot of what we choose to do with these desires is something that society has provided - similar to how we don't just steal what our neighbor has just because we want it or have less, but instead have learned to work together in ways that at least benefit the majority in certain ways. \n\nThis is true in many domains with people - our lot is to exist between a multiplicity of tensions of opposites. We want to be present-oriented to enjoy ourselves, but we have to be future-oriented to maintain longevity, and past-orientation can teach us a lot of things. Too much of any one and we'll be employing sub-optimal living strategies.

Humans evolved to employ reason (at least to some extent) and so we can exercise that reason and try to sculpt the life and lifeview that we wish to use during the exceedingly brief time when we're alive. \n\nSo, no - humans aren't meant to be monogamous. But nor are we meant to be polyamorous, or whatever word you want to use to refer to having a multiplicity of partners. We are, however, able to do all of those things.\n\nThat said, you're all over the place. Cheating isn't coincidental; it's an indication of a relationship breakdown. It doesn't relate to evolutionary theory as much as a dynamic between two people. If someone wants to screw around, they can break up or create an open relationship. What you're talking about is dishonesty and betrayal. Relationships fail a lot because yeah people are dishonest and wounded and there's a lot going on. \n\n\"The one\" has nothing to do with it. That's romance movie talk. A good relationship has to do with being with someone you respect and love and are attracted to - and all that to an adequate enough degree. And you could screw other people, sure - but maybe you do want to be with your partner, so you willingly put that aside. Are there perhaps other, more attractive people out there? Sure, probably. But it's about maturity, and understanding that you have found someone good enough to spend your time with, someone you can be happy with. And there are a multiplicity of such other humans in the world that would work with you, and that you would work with. And so you find someone who you work well enough with, and who works well enough with you, and you create rules to establish a sense of emotional safety, which for the majority of the population is monogamy. And that's another important point - relationships are not only about sex. Emotional needs are even bigger, in my experience. The desire to be with someone, to not be alone, to be known, to have someone you know you can rely on - all those things are benefits of relationships. On reddit we tend predominantly see the worst relationship moments, the most dramatically messed up people, and since the loudest population on here is the youngest population - that 13-25 year old demographic - there is also a lot about sex, which gives a lot of people the mistaken notion that motivation for sex really, actually is the #1 thing keeping people together. It's up there, and it's huge, but it's a revolving carousel of really crucial shit, without which a lot of people feel their lives are the poorer for it.\n\nThis is not to say that being someone who actively eschews monogamy means you're unhealthy. However, it is a relatively small percentage of the population who can truly persist as polyamorous individuals. As I say, humanity is all over the spectrum - so these people are legitimately the way they are, and that's fine. That, too, doesn't constitute an indictment of monogamy - just as there being lots of dyed-in-the-wool monogamists doesn't constitute an indictment of polyamory. ",
    "rejected": "I think the problem is self-awareness, and you seem to already recognize this.\n\nThere is a division between sexuality in humans, and sexuality in (most) other species. That is, sex and romance aren't the same thing.\n\nThere are various benefits and drawbacks to various levels of sexual monogamy in species. Smaller, fast breeding species tend to have no monogamy. Species with long developmental times tend to have more monogamy. Both are valid tactics. Our closest biological relatives is an even split between Chimpanzees and Bonobos. Neither are sexually monogamous, and there's no compelling reason to believe that humans are biologically wired to be sexually monogamous either.\n\nYou want to know if sexual biology prompts is to be promiscuous? Yes. There, you can go home now.\n\nThe reason that that's not a satisfying answer is that sexual biology isn't all there is. Humans are self aware. We have psychology as well, and psychology is rooted in and can affect biology.\n\nWith self-awareness, and group behavior, we gained social needs. Social needs affect a person's psychological state, which affects a person's physical well being. With sexual biology, mating is about reproduction. With humanity's self-aware group psychology, mating is about Love (read: affection, infatuation, respect, desire, security, safety, comfort, etc.. I'll be using Love (capitol) to refer to all these aspects of relationships at once). Love (psychology) trumps lust (sexuality) most of the time in with humans because most of the time societal interactions (psychology) are more important for humans in matters of health, prosperity, and reproduction than base biological needs.\n\nOther users have posted that there is no \"should\" in this case. That's not quite right. What we \"should\" do is what is most conducive (individually and as a species) to survival, health, happiness, and advancement.\n\nSo while being sexually monogamous might not be optimal, being romantically monogamous can be. \n\nTo generalize, females benefit from monogamy because it helps to guarantee that their child will be cared for. For males monogamy is beneficial because it helps guarantee that their children are genetically theirs. Females are disadvantaged by monogamy because they could potentially get better genes for their child while with a worse mate. Males are disadvantaged by monogamy because multiple partners means more children (which may potentially be taken care of for free by another man).\n\nThat's the biology. Socially, however, both men and women benefit from monogamy. The implicit purpose of sex is reproduction. The choice to have sex and the choice to reproduce have become relatively divorced from one another in modern first-world society. However, all of the biological drives that males and females have for their children that are tied to mating have colored our culture.\n\nSex and Love are treated roughly the same societally. This is especially true once one is in a relationship. If one fails to be monogamous sexually, this is seen as a violation of monogamy relationally. This generally makes at least one person in the relationship very angry, which damages the relationship. Damage to a relationship generally causes all members of the relationship stress and emotional trauma. Stress and emotional trauma impact the advancement, happiness, health, and sometimes security of those damaged by the transgression.\n\nSo why should humans be monogamous? Because it hurts us not to be. This obviously isn't the case across the board, because some people are clearly capable of happy polyamorous relationships, but is true generally because people are selfish and unwilling (or able) to fully Love more than one person."

And that that shipment causes the food distributor to order more turkeys? And that that shipment causes a farm to slaughter more turkeys?\" \n\nThe number of animals produced and slaughtered is so high that the very small probability of you sparing an animal from it still translates to 50-100 animals per year.

    "rejected": "I agree with /u/huadpe that simply the act of being vegetarian/vegan makes it easier for other people to reduce their meat consumption, because as the population of vegetarians and vegans expands, restaurants are offering more and better vegetarian/vegan options, including some that are so tasty only the most rabid carnivores would turn their nose up at them. The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn't worth eating.\n\nHelping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles. (I'm not sure how that figure was calculated, but if it's even close to correct, it demonstrates the kind of difference skipping meat just three meals a week could make.)"

This can be seen in four easy reasons: \n \n1. *It's easy to see what everyone else is doing and it's easy to see what they did wrong.* You see everything from the same perceptive so you can critique other players in detail and KNOW they messed up (even as you mess up yourself)\n \n2. *Your success depends entirely on the team.* Unlike other games it's not about you doing well; your personal score counters for shit if you don't win the game.\n \n3. *Asymmetrical positions.* A good support score is not equal to a good AD carry score. Thus the person with the best score on the team might be the worst player. Thus there's no objective way to tell who is doing the best on the team so everyone can blame everyone and people don't shut up when they are doing badly.\n \n4. *Anonymity.* You will never see the players you're playing with again.

    "chosen": "I could sit here and give you a bunch of scenarios where anyone could have a reason to say those slurs, but I don't think that's exactly what you're going for here. I think the general principle is flawed to begin with. Let me explain. \n\nThe word \"faggot\" isn't the insult, it's what that word is meant to describe that is. The only reason it's insulting, derogatory, and considered a slur is not because of the word itself, it's because of society's collectively wrong (but finally dwindling) belief that being gay doesn't make you less of a man, or that being gay isn't actually insulting to begin with. So when someone writes \"OP is a faggot\", the part of that's insulting isn't the word, it's what that word means. \n\nMy point is that I think if we focus on the words that are said we lose sight of what's important, and that's changing society's collective perception of LGBT. And that's kind of the problem. Unless you change societal views about any condition, just the term describing that condition is enough to be used as an insult. Look at the word \"retard\". It was, by all measures, a medically accepted term for certain mental conditions. It's even a correct descriptive term which means \"slowed\". The word itself isn't what's insulting, it's the connotation that the target has that condition that is. And so whatever word you use to describe the condition will be the insult. But instead of dealing with that we've bullshitted ourselves into thinking that if we change the offensive word the insults offensiveness and the reason people use it to be insulting will go away.\n\nMy reason for allowing its use is that it's a distraction to the greater problem of changing society, plus it makes many people just not care. If your biggest problem is that a word is offensive then you only sound like a middle-aged bored soccer mom complaining about that house down the street where the teenagers were having a party. Focusing on it makes it seem like you don't have any *real* problems at all, so your movement ends up not having as much support as it could have had. I get that it's hurtful to some people, but I also get that taking issue with the use of derogatory words or homophobic slurs is counter-productive in the end.\n\nEnding question.
